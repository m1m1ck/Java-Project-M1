CHAPTER I.
Down the Rabbit-Hole


Alicuble of getting up and
picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
close by her.

There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it
so _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, â€œOh
dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!â€ (when she thought it over afterwards,
it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the
time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a
watch out of its waistcoat-nt straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then
dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think
about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very
deep well.

Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had
plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what
was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out
what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she
looked at thas this, I shall
think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave theyâ€™ll all think me
at home! Why, I wouldnâ€™t say anything about it, even if I fell off the
top of the house!â€ (Which was very likely true.)

Down, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? â€œI wonder how
many miles Iâ€™ve fallen by this time?â€ she said aloud. â€œI must be
getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would
be four thousand miles down, I thinkâ€”â€ (for, you see, Alicer if I shall fall right _through_
the earth! How funny itâ€™ll seem to come out among the people that walk
with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I thinkâ€”â€ (she was rather
glad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didnâ€™t sound at all
the right word) â€œâ€”but I shall have to ask them what the name of the
country is, you know. Please, Maâ€™am, is this New Zealand or Australia?â€
(and she tried to curtsey as she spokeâ€”fancy _curtseying_ as youâ€™re
falling through thIâ€™m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and thatâ€™s
very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?â€ And here
Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a
dreamy sort of way, â€œDo cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?â€ and
sometimes, â€œDo bats eat cats?â€ for, you see, as she couldnâ€™t answer
either question, it didnâ€™t much matter which way she put it. She felt
that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was
walking hand in ha,
and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, â€œOh my ears
and whiskers, how late itâ€™s getting!â€ She was close behind it when she
turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found
herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging
from the roof.

There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when
Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every
door, she walked sadly down the middlettle door about fifteen inches high: she tried the
little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!

Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not
much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the
passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get
out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright
flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head
through the doorway; â€œand eve at
any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this
time she found a little bottle on it, (â€œwhich certainly was not here
before,â€ said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper
label, with the words â€œDRINK ME,â€ beautifully printed on it in large
letters.

It was all very well to say â€œDrink me,â€ but the wise little Alice was
not going to do _that_ in a hurry. â€œNo, Iâ€™ll look first,â€ she said,
â€œand see whether itâ€™s marked â€˜_poison_â€to disagree with you,
sooner or later.

However, this bottle was _not_ marked â€œpoison,â€ so Alice ventured to
taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed
flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and
hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.

*      *      *      *      *      *      *

    *      *      *      *      *      *

*      *      *      *      *      *      *


â€œWhat a curious feeling!â€ said Alice; â€œ like then?â€ And she tried to fancy what the
flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could
not remember ever having seen such a thing.

After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going
into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the
door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she
went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach
it: she could see it quite plainly through thece she remembered trying to box her own ears for having
cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,
for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.
â€œBut itâ€™s no use now,â€ thought poor Alice, â€œto pretend to be two
people! Why, thereâ€™s hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable
person!â€

Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:
she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the wormained the same
size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice
had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way
things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go
on in the common way.

So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.

*      *      *      *      *      *      *

    *      *      *      *      *      *

*      *      *      *      *      *      *




CHAPTER II.
The Pool of Tears


â€œCuo trouble
myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;â€”but I must be
kind to them,â€ thought Alice, â€œor perhaps they wonâ€™t walk the way I
want to go! Let me see: Iâ€™ll give them a new pair of boots every
Christmas.â€

And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. â€œThey must
go by the carrier,â€ she thought; â€œand how funny itâ€™ll seem, sending
presents to oneâ€™s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!

     _Aliceâ€™s Right Foot, Esq., H€œYou ought to be ashamed of yourself,â€ said Alice, â€œa great girl like
you,â€ (she might well say this), â€œto go on crying in this way! Stop
this moment, I tell you!â€ But she went on all the same, shedding
gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about
four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.

After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and
she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White
Rabbit returning, spnd skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.

Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she
kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: â€œDear, dear! How
queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.
I wonder if Iâ€™ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the
same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling
a little different. But if Iâ€™m not the same, the next question is, Who
in ow
puzzling it all is! Iâ€™ll try if I know all the things I used to know.
Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,
and four times seven isâ€”oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that
rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesnâ€™t signify: letâ€™s try
Geography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of
Rome, and Romeâ€”no, _thatâ€™s_ all wrong, Iâ€™m certain! I must have been
changed for Mabel! Iâ€™ll try and say â€˜_How doth the littre not the right words,â€ said poor Alice, and her eyes
filled with tears again as she went on, â€œI must be Mabel after all, and
I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to
no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, Iâ€™ve
made up my mind about it; if Iâ€™m Mabel, Iâ€™ll stay down here! Itâ€™ll be
no use their putting their heads down and saying â€˜Come up again, dear!â€™
I shall only look up and say â€˜Who am I then? Tell me that first, e
growing small again.â€ She got up and went to the table to measure
herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was
now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon
found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she
dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.

â€œThat _was_ a narrow escape!â€ said Alice, a good deal frightened at the
sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; â€somehow fallen into the sea, â€œand in that case I can go back by
railway,â€ she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in
her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go
to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the
sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row
of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she
soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when
she wll
she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had
slipped in like herself.

â€œWould it be of any use, now,â€ thought Alice, â€œto speak to this mouse?
Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very
likely it can talk: at any rate, thereâ€™s no harm in trying.â€ So she
began: â€œO Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired
of swimming about here, O Mouse!â€ (Alice thought this must be the right
way of speaking to a mouse: s notion how long ago
anything had happened.) So she began again: â€œOÃ¹ est ma chatte?â€ which
was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a
sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with
fright. â€œOh, I beg your pardon!â€ cried Alice hastily, afraid that she
had hurt the poor animalâ€™s feelings. â€œI quite forgot you didnâ€™t like
cats.â€

â€œNot like cats!â€ cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. â€œWould
_you_ like cats if you werâ€”oh, I beg your
pardon!â€ cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all
over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. â€œWe wonâ€™t talk
about her any more if youâ€™d rather not.â€

â€œWe indeed!â€ cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his
tail. â€œAs if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always
_hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Donâ€™t let me hear the name
again!â€

â€œI wonâ€™t indeed!â€ said Alice, in a great hurry to co useful, itâ€™s worth a hundred pounds! He says
it kills all the rats andâ€”oh dear!â€ cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,
â€œIâ€™m afraid Iâ€™ve offended it again!â€ For the Mouse was swimming away
from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the
pool as it went.

So she called softly after it, â€œMouse dear! Do come back again, and we
wonâ€™t talk about cats or dogs either, if you donâ€™t like them!â€ When the
Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back 


CHAPTER III.
A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale


They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bankâ€”the
birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close
to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.

The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a
consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite
natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if
she had known them all her life. Ind ring, with the
Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she
felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.

â€œAhem!â€ said the Mouse with an important air, â€œare you all ready? This
is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! â€˜William
the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted
to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much
accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin 
â€œFound _it_,â€ the Mouse replied rather crossly: â€œof course you know
what â€˜itâ€™ means.â€

â€œI know what â€˜itâ€™ means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,â€ said the
Duck: â€œitâ€™s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the
archbishop find?â€

The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, â€œâ€˜â€”found
it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him
the crown. Williamâ€™s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolenc™t believe you do either!â€ And
the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds
tittered audibly.

â€œWhat I was going to say,â€ said the Dodo in an offended tone, â€œwas,
that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.â€

â€œWhat _is_ a Caucus-race?â€ said Alice; not that she wanted much to
know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that _somebody_ ought to
speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.

â€œWhy,â€ said the Dodo, â€œtas over. However,
when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry
again, the Dodo suddenly called out â€œThe race is over!â€ and they all
crowded round it, panting, and asking, â€œBut who has won?â€

This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of
thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its
forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the
pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo
sprizes. There was exactly
one a-piece, all round.

â€œBut she must have a prize herself, you know,â€ said the Mouse.

â€œOf course,â€ the Dodo replied very gravely. â€œWhat else have you got in
your pocket?â€ he went on, turning to Alice.

â€œOnly a thimble,â€ said Alice sadly.

â€œHand it over here,â€ said the Dodo.

Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly
presented the thimble, saying â€œWe beg your acceptance of this elegant
thimble;â€ and, when it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and
begged the Mouse to tell them something more.

â€œYou promised to tell me your history, you know,â€ said Alice, â€œand why
it is you hateâ€”C and D,â€ she added in a whisper, half afraid that it
would be offended again.

â€œMine is a long and a sad tale!â€ said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and
sighing.

â€œIt _is_ a long tail, certainly,â€ said Alice, looking down with wonder
at the Mouseâ€™s tail; â€œbut why do you call 
         â€˜Iâ€™ll be judge, Iâ€™ll be jury,â€™ Said cunning old Fury: â€˜Iâ€™ll
         try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.â€™â€

â€œYou are not attending!â€ said the Mouse to Alice severely. â€œWhat are
you thinking of?â€

â€œI beg your pardon,â€ said Alice very humbly: â€œyou had got to the fifth
bend, I think?â€

â€œI had _not!_â€ cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.

â€œA knot!â€ said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking
anxiously aboked a little quicker.

â€œWhat a pity it wouldnâ€™t stay!â€ sighed the Lory, as soon as it was
quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to
her daughter â€œAh, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose
_your_ temper!â€ â€œHold your tongue, Ma!â€ said the young Crab, a little
snappishly. â€œYouâ€™re enough to try the patience of an oyster!â€

â€œI wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!â€ said Alice aloud,
addressing nobody in particular. â€œSheâ€™degan wrapping itself up very
carefully, remarking, â€œI really must be getting home; the night-air
doesnâ€™t suit my throat!â€ and a Canary called out in a trembling voice
to its children, â€œCome away, my dears! Itâ€™s high time you were all in
bed!â€ On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left
alone.

â€œI wish I hadnâ€™t mentioned Dinah!â€ she said to herself in a melancholy
tone. â€œNobody seems to like her, down here, and Iâ€™m sure sheâ€™s the best
cat in thnxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard
it muttering to itself â€œThe Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh
my fur and whiskers! Sheâ€™ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are
ferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?â€ Alice guessed in a
moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid
gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but
they were nowhere to be seenâ€”everything seemed to have changed since
hk me for his housemaid,â€ she said to herself as she ran. â€œHow
surprised heâ€™ll be when he finds out who I am! But Iâ€™d better take him
his fan and glovesâ€”that is, if I can find them.â€ As she said this, she
came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass
plate with the name â€œW. RABBIT,â€ engraved upon it. She went in without
knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the
real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had ing people about like that!â€

By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table
in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three
pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the
gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a
little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label
this time with the words â€œDRINK ME,â€ but nevertheless she uncorked it
and put it to her lips. â€œI know _somo herself â€œThatâ€™s quite enoughâ€”I hope I shanâ€™t
grow any moreâ€”As it is, I canâ€™t get out at the doorâ€”I do wish I hadnâ€™t
drunk quite so much!â€

Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,
and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there
was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with
one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.
Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, rowing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and
rabbits. I almost wish I hadnâ€™t gone down that rabbit-holeâ€”and yetâ€”and
yetâ€”itâ€™s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what
_can_ have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied
that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of
one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And
when I grow up, Iâ€™ll write oneâ€”but Iâ€™m grown up now,â€ she addent on, taking first one side and then the other, and
making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes
she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.

â€œMary Ann! Mary Ann!â€ said the voice. â€œFetch me my gloves this moment!â€
Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was
the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the
house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as
large as the Rabbit, and had  hold of anything,
but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,
from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a
cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.

Next came an angry voiceâ€”the Rabbitâ€™sâ€”â€œPat! Pat! Where are you?â€ And
then a voice she had never heard before, â€œSure then Iâ€™m here! Digging
for apples, yer honour!â€

â€œDigging for apples, indeed!â€ said the Rabbit angrily. â€œHere! Come and
help me out of _this!_â€ (re, I donâ€™t like it, yer honour, at all, at
all!â€ â€œDo as I tell you, you coward!â€ and at last she spread out her
hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were
_two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. â€œWhat a number
of cucumber-frames there must be!â€ thought Alice. â€œI wonder what
theyâ€™ll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they
_could!_ Iâ€™m sure _I_ donâ€™t want to stay in here any longer!â€

She waited for somee roof bear?â€”Mind that loose slateâ€”Oh, itâ€™s coming down!
Heads below!â€ (a loud crash)â€”â€œNow, who did that?â€”It was Bill, I
fancyâ€”Whoâ€™s to go down the chimney?â€”Nay, _I_ shanâ€™t! _You_ do
it!â€”_That_ I wonâ€™t, then!â€”Billâ€™s to go downâ€”Here, Bill! the master says
youâ€™re to go down the chimney!â€

â€œOh! So Billâ€™s got to come down the chimney, has he?â€ said Alice to
herself. â€œShy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldnâ€™t be in
Billâ€™s place for abbitâ€™s voice alongâ€”â€œCatch him, you by the hedge!â€ then
silence, and then another confusion of voicesâ€”â€œHold up his headâ€”Brandy
nowâ€”Donâ€™t choke himâ€”How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell
us all about it!â€

Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (â€œThatâ€™s Bill,â€ thought
Alice,) â€œWell, I hardly knowâ€”No more, thank ye; Iâ€™m better nowâ€”but Iâ€™m
a deal too flustered to tell youâ€”all I know is, something comes at me
like a Jack-in-the-box, anwill do, to begin with.â€

â€œA barrowful of _what?_â€ thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,
for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the
window, and some of them hit her in the face. â€œIâ€™ll put a stop to
this,â€ she said to herself, and shouted out, â€œYouâ€™d better not do that
again!â€ which produced another dead silence.

Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into
little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a brigh the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it
something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she
appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself
safe in a thick wood.

â€œThe first thing Iâ€™ve got to do,â€ said Alice to herself, as she
wandered about in the wood, â€œis to grow to my right size again; and the
second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that
will be the best plan.â€

It sounded an exce she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it
might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in
spite of all her coaxing.

Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and
held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off
all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,
and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,
to keep herself from being run over; and the n a good way off, panting, with
its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.

This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she
set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath,
and till the puppyâ€™s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.

â€œAnd yet what a dear little puppy it was!â€ said Alice, as she leant
against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the
leaves: â€œI should have liked teaching ite mushroom growing near her, about the same height as
herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and
behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what
was on the top of it.

She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the
mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue
caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly
smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of
t have been
changed several times since then.â€

â€œWhat do you mean by that?â€ said the Caterpillar sternly. â€œExplain
yourself!â€

â€œI canâ€™t explain _myself_, Iâ€™m afraid, sir,â€ said Alice, â€œbecause Iâ€™m
not myself, you see.â€

â€œI donâ€™t see,â€ said the Caterpillar.

â€œIâ€™m afraid I canâ€™t put it more clearly,â€ Alice replied very politely,
â€œfor I canâ€™t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many
different sizes in a day is very confusing.â€
usly. â€œWho are _you?_â€

Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.
Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillarâ€™s making such _very_
short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, â€œI
think, you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first.â€

â€œWhy?â€ said the Caterpillar.

Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any
good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant
state of mind, she tus it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded
its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, â€œSo you
think youâ€™re changed, do you?â€

â€œIâ€™m afraid I am, sir,â€ said Alice; â€œI canâ€™t remember things as I
usedâ€”and I donâ€™t keep the same size for ten minutes together!â€

â€œCanâ€™t remember _what_ things?â€ said the Caterpillar.

â€œWell, Iâ€™ve tried to say â€œHow doth the little busy bee,â€ but it all
came different!â€ Alice replied in a veryt again and again.â€

â€œYou are old,â€ said the youth, â€œas I mentioned before,
    And have grown most uncommonly fat;
Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the doorâ€”
    Pray, what is the reason of that?â€

â€œIn my youth,â€ said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,
    â€œI kept all my limbs very supple
By the use of this ointmentâ€”one shilling the boxâ€”
    Allow me to sell you a couple?â€

â€œYou are old,â€ said the youth, â€œand your jaws are too weak
    For any so awfully clever?â€

â€œI have answered three questions, and that is enough,â€
    Said his father; â€œdonâ€™t give yourself airs!
Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
    Be off, or Iâ€™ll kick you down stairs!â€


â€œThat is not said right,â€ said the Caterpillar.

â€œNot _quite_ right, Iâ€™m afraid,â€ said Alice, timidly; â€œsome of the
words have got altered.â€

â€œIt is wrong from beginning to end,â€ said the Caterpillar decidedly,
and there was silence fo_little_ larger, sir, if you wouldnâ€™t
mind,â€ said Alice: â€œthree inches is such a wretched height to be.â€

â€œIt is a very good height indeed!â€ said the Caterpillar angrily,
rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).

â€œBut Iâ€™m not used to it!â€ pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she
thought of herself, â€œI wish the creatures wouldnâ€™t be so easily
offended!â€

â€œYouâ€™ll get used to it in time,â€ said the Caterpillar; and it put the
â€œOf the mushroom,â€ said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it
aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.

Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute,
trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was
perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at
last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke
off a bit of the edge with each hand.

â€œAnd now which is which?â€ she said to herself, a of the
lefthand bit.

*      *      *      *      *      *      *

    *      *      *      *      *      *

*      *      *      *      *      *      *


â€œCome, my headâ€™s free at last!â€ said Alice in a tone of delight, which
changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders
were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was
an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a
sea of green leaves that lay far below hShe
had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was
going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but
the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp
hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her
face, and was beating her violently with its wings.

â€œSerpent!â€ screamed the Pigeon.

â€œIâ€™m _not_ a serpent!â€ said Alice indignantly. â€œLet me alone!â€

â€œSerpent, I say again!â€ repeated the he Pigeon had finished.

â€œAs if it wasnâ€™t trouble enough hatching the eggs,â€ said the Pigeon;
â€œbut I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I
havenâ€™t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!â€

â€œIâ€™m very sorry youâ€™ve been annoyed,â€ said Alice, who was beginning to
see its meaning.

â€œAnd just as Iâ€™d taken the highest tree in the wood,â€ continued the
Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, â€œand just as I was thinking I
should be free of them at  good many little girls in my time, but never
_one_ with such a neck as that! No, no! Youâ€™re a serpent; and thereâ€™s
no use denying it. I suppose youâ€™ll be telling me next that you never
tasted an egg!â€

â€œI _have_ tasted eggs, certainly,â€ said Alice, who was a very truthful
child; â€œbut little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you
know.â€

â€œI donâ€™t believe it,â€ said the Pigeon; â€œbut if they do, why then
theyâ€™re a kind of serpent, thatâ€™s all I can saygeon in a sulky tone, as it settled
down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well
as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches,
and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while
she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands,
and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at
the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until
she had succeeded in bringing herself As she said this, she came suddenly
upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.
â€œWhoever lives there,â€ thought Alice, â€œitâ€™ll never do to come upon them
_this_ size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!â€ So she
began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go
near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.




CHAPTER VI.
Pig and Pepper


For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and woll
about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.

The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,
nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,
saying, in a solemn tone, â€œFor the Duchess. An invitation from the
Queen to play croquet.â€ The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn
tone, only changing the order of the words a little, â€œFrom the Queen.
An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.â€

Then they both bowed low, anecondly, because theyâ€™re making such a noise inside, no one could
possibly hear you.â€ And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary
noise going on withinâ€”a constant howling and sneezing, and every now
and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to
pieces.

â€œPlease, then,â€ said Alice, â€œhow am I to get in?â€

â€œThere might be some sense in your knocking,â€ the Footman went on
without attending to her, â€œif we had the door between us. For instance,
if yened, and a large plate came
skimming out, straight at the Footmanâ€™s head: it just grazed his nose,
and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.

â€œâ€”or next day, maybe,â€ the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly
as if nothing had happened.

â€œHow am I to get in?â€ asked Alice again, in a louder tone.

â€œ_Are_ you to get in at all?â€ said the Footman. â€œThatâ€™s the first
question, you know.â€

It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. â€œy idiotic!â€ And she opened the door and went in.

The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from
one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool
in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire,
stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.

â€œThereâ€™s certainly too much pepper in that soup!â€ Alice said to
herself, as well as she could for sneezing.

There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the â€œand thatâ€™s why. Pig!â€

She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite
jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the
baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:â€”

â€œI didnâ€™t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didnâ€™t
know that cats _could_ grin.â€

â€œThey all can,â€ said the Duchess; â€œand most of â€™em do.â€

â€œI donâ€™t know of any that do,â€ Alice said very politely, feeling quite
pleased d dishes. The Duchess took no notice of
them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,
that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.

â€œOh, _please_ mind what youâ€™re doing!â€ cried Alice, jumping up and down
in an agony of terror. â€œOh, there goes his _precious_ nose!â€ as an
unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it
off.

â€œIf everybody minded their own business,â€ the Duchess said in a hoarse
growl, âe cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to
be listening, so she went on again: â€œTwenty-four hours, I _think_; or
is it twelve? Iâ€”â€

â€œOh, donâ€™t bother _me_,â€ said the Duchess; â€œI never could abide
figures!â€ And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a
sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at
the end of every line:

â€œSpeak roughly to your little boy,
    And beat him when he sneezes:
He only does it to annoy,
    it a bit, if you like!â€ the Duchess said to Alice,
flinging the baby at her as she spoke. â€œI must go and get ready to play
croquet with the Queen,â€ and she hurried out of the room. The cook
threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.

Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped
little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions,
â€œjust like a star-fish,â€ thought Alice. The poor little thing was
snorting like a stetheyâ€™re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldnâ€™t it be
murder to leave it behind?â€ She said the last words out loud, and the
little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).
â€œDonâ€™t grunt,â€ said Alice; â€œthatâ€™s not at all a proper way of
expressing yourself.â€

The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face
to see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had
a _very_ turn-up nose, much more like a snout thaney went on for some while in silence.

Alice was just beginning to think to herself, â€œNow, what am I to do
with this creature when I get it home?â€ when it grunted again, so
violently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time
there could be _no_ mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than
a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it
further.

So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it
trot away quietly ired, she
thought: still it had _very_ long claws and a great many teeth, so she
felt that it ought to be treated with respect.

â€œCheshire Puss,â€ she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know
whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little
wider. â€œCome, itâ€™s pleased so far,â€ thought Alice, and she went on.
â€œWould you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?â€

â€œThat depends a good deal on where you want to get to,â€ said the Cat.

â€direction,â€ waving the other paw, â€œlives a
March Hare. Visit either you like: theyâ€™re both mad.â€

â€œBut I donâ€™t want to go among mad people,â€ Alice remarked.

â€œOh, you canâ€™t help that,â€ said the Cat: â€œweâ€™re all mad here. Iâ€™m mad.
Youâ€™re mad.â€

â€œHow do you know Iâ€™m mad?â€ said Alice.

â€œYou must be,â€ said the Cat, â€œor you wouldnâ€™t have come here.â€

Alice didnâ€™t think that proved it at all; however, she went on â€œAnd how
do you know that yâ€œI should like it very much,â€ said Alice, â€œbut I havenâ€™t been invited
yet.â€

â€œYouâ€™ll see me there,â€ said the Cat, and vanished.

Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer
things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,
it suddenly appeared again.

â€œBy-the-bye, what became of the baby?â€ said the Cat. â€œIâ€™d nearly
forgotten to ask.â€

â€œIt turned into a pig,â€ Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back up, and there was the Cat
again, sitting on a branch of a tree.

â€œDid you say pig, or fig?â€ said the Cat.

â€œI said pig,â€ replied Alice; â€œand I wish you wouldnâ€™t keep appearing
and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.â€

â€œAll right,â€ said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,
beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which
remained some time after the rest of it had gone.

â€œWell! Iâ€™ve often seen a cat without a grin,â€ ed up towards it rather
timidly, saying to herself â€œSuppose it should be raving mad after all!
I almost wish Iâ€™d gone to see the Hatter instead!â€




CHAPTER VII.
A Mad Tea-Party


There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the
March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting
between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a
cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. â€œVery
uncomfortable for thon it but tea.
â€œI donâ€™t see any wine,â€ she remarked.

â€œThere isnâ€™t any,â€ said the March Hare.

â€œThen it wasnâ€™t very civil of you to offer it,â€ said Alice angrily.

â€œIt wasnâ€™t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,â€ said
the March Hare.

â€œI didnâ€™t know it was _your_ table,â€ said Alice; â€œitâ€™s laid for a great
many more than three.â€

â€œYour hair wants cutting,â€ said the Hatter. He had been looking at
Alice for some time with great c€ said
the March Hare.

â€œExactly so,â€ said Alice.

â€œThen you should say what you mean,â€ the March Hare went on.

â€œI do,â€ Alice hastily replied; â€œat leastâ€”at least I mean what I
sayâ€”thatâ€™s the same thing, you know.â€

â€œNot the same thing a bit!â€ said the Hatter. â€œYou might just as well
say that â€˜I see what I eatâ€™ is the same thing as â€˜I eat what I seeâ€™!â€

â€œYou might just as well say,â€ added the March Hare, â€œthat â€˜I like what
I getâ€™ is to break the silence. â€œWhat day of the month
is it?â€ he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his
pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,
and holding it to his ear.

Alice considered a little, and then said â€œThe fourth.â€

â€œTwo days wrong!â€ sighed the Hatter. â€œI told you butter wouldnâ€™t suit
the works!â€ he added looking angrily at the March Hare.

â€œIt was the _best_ butter,â€ the March Hare meekly replied.

â€œYes, bund doesnâ€™t
tell what oâ€™clock it is!â€

â€œWhy should it?â€ muttered the Hatter. â€œDoes _your_ watch tell you what
year it is?â€

â€œOf course not,â€ Alice replied very readily: â€œbut thatâ€™s because it
stays the same year for such a long time together.â€

â€œWhich is just the case with _mine_,â€ said the Hatter.

Alice felt dreadfully puzzled, The Hatterâ€™s remark seemed to have no
sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. â€œI donâ€™t quite
understand ytter.

â€œNor I,â€ said the March Hare.

Alice sighed wearily. â€œI think you might do something better with the
time,â€ she said, â€œthan waste it in asking riddles that have no
answers.â€

â€œIf you knew Time as well as I do,â€ said the Hatter, â€œyou wouldnâ€™t talk
about wasting _it_. Itâ€™s _him_.â€

â€œI donâ€™t know what you mean,â€ said Alice.

â€œOf course you donâ€™t!â€ the Hatter said, tossing his head
contemptuously. â€œI dare say you never even spoke to Time!â€

(â€œI only wish it was,â€ the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)

â€œThat would be grand, certainly,â€ said Alice thoughtfully: â€œbut thenâ€”I
shouldnâ€™t be hungry for it, you know.â€

â€œNot at first, perhaps,â€ said the Hatter: â€œbut you could keep it to
half-past one as long as you liked.â€

â€œIs that the way _you_ manage?â€ Alice asked.

The Hatter shook his head mournfully. â€œNot I!â€ he replied. â€œWe
quarrelled last Marchâ€”just before _he_ went mad, you kormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep
â€œ_Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle_â€”â€ and went on so long that they
had to pinch it to make it stop.

â€œWell, Iâ€™d hardly finished the first verse,â€ said the Hatter, â€œwhen the
Queen jumped up and bawled out, â€˜Heâ€™s murdering the time! Off with his
head!â€™â€

â€œHow dreadfully savage!â€ exclaimed Alice.

â€œAnd ever since that,â€ the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, â€œhe wonâ€™t
do a thing I ask! Itâ€™s always

â€œSuppose we change the subject,â€ the March Hare interrupted, yawning.
â€œIâ€™m getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.â€

â€œIâ€™m afraid I donâ€™t know one,â€ said Alice, rather alarmed at the
proposal.

â€œThen the Dormouse shall!â€ they both cried. â€œWake up, Dormouse!â€ And
they pinched it on both sides at once.

The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. â€œI wasnâ€™t asleep,â€ he said in a
hoarse, feeble voice: â€œI heard every word you fellows wered drinking.

â€œThey lived on treacle,â€ said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or
two.

â€œThey couldnâ€™t have done that, you know,â€ Alice gently remarked;
â€œtheyâ€™d have been ill.â€

â€œSo they were,â€ said the Dormouse; â€œ_very_ ill.â€

Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary way of
living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: â€œBut
why did they live at the bottom of a well?â€

â€œTake some more tea,â€ the March Hare saiduse, and
repeated her question. â€œWhy did they live at the bottom of a well?â€

The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then
said, â€œIt was a treacle-well.â€

â€œThereâ€™s no such thing!â€ Alice was beginning very angrily, but the
Hatter and the March Hare went â€œSh! sh!â€ and the Dormouse sulkily
remarked, â€œIf you canâ€™t be civil, youâ€™d better finish the story for
yourself.â€

â€œNo, please go on!â€ Alice said very humbly; â€œI wonâ€™t interrupt a him: the March Hare
moved into the Dormouseâ€™s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the
place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any
advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than
before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.

Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very
cautiously: â€œBut I donâ€™t understand. Where did they draw the treacle
from?â€

â€œYou can draw water out of a water-well,very sleepy; â€œand they drew all manner of
thingsâ€”everything that begins with an Mâ€”â€

â€œWhy with an M?â€ said Alice.

â€œWhy not?â€ said the March Hare.

Alice was silent.

The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a
doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a
little shriek, and went on: â€œâ€”that begins with an M, such as
mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchnessâ€”you know you say
things are â€œmuch of a muchn
the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into
the teapot.

â€œAt any rate Iâ€™ll never go _there_ again!â€ said Alice as she picked her
way through the wood. â€œItâ€™s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in
all my life!â€

Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door
leading right into it. â€œThatâ€™s very curious!â€ she thought. â€œBut
everythingâ€™s curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.â€ And
in she went.

Once mohe cool fountains.




CHAPTER VIII.
The Queenâ€™s Croquet-Ground


A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses
growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily
painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she
went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard
one of them say, â€œLook out now, Five! Donâ€™t go splashing paint over me
like that!â€

â€œI couldnâ€™t help it,â€ said Five, in a sulky tâ€

Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun â€œWell, of all the unjust
thingsâ€”â€ when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching
them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also,
and all of them bowed low.

â€œWould you tell me,â€ said Alice, a little timidly, â€œwhy you are
painting those roses?â€

Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low
voice, â€œWhy the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a
 soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the
three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the
corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with
diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came
the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came
jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all
ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens,
and among them Alice recoides, what would be the use of a
procession,â€ thought she, â€œif people had all to lie down upon their
faces, so that they couldnâ€™t see it?â€ So she stood still where she was,
and waited.

When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked
at her, and the Queen said severely â€œWho is this?â€ She said it to the
Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.

â€œIdiot!â€ said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to
Alice, she went on, âners, or soldiers,
or courtiers, or three of her own children.

â€œHow should _I_ know?â€ said Alice, surprised at her own courage. â€œItâ€™s
no business of _mine_.â€

The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a
moment like a wild beast, screamed â€œOff with her head! Offâ€”â€

â€œNonsense!â€ said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was
silent.

The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said â€œConsider, my
dear: she is only a child!â€please your Majesty,â€ said Two, in a very humble tone, going
down on one knee as he spoke, â€œwe were tryingâ€”â€

â€œ_I_ see!â€ said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.
â€œOff with their heads!â€ and the procession moved on, three of the
soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran
to Alice for protection.

â€œYou shanâ€™t be beheaded!â€ said Alice, and she put them into a large
flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered ion,
wondering very much what would happen next.

â€œItâ€™sâ€”itâ€™s a very fine day!â€ said a timid voice at her side. She was
walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.

â€œVery,â€ said Alice: â€œâ€”whereâ€™s the Duchess?â€

â€œHush! Hush!â€ said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked
anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon
tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered â€œSheâ€™s under
sentence of execution.â of thunder, and
people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each
other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game
began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground
in her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live
hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double
themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.

The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managidgehog
had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all
this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she
wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were
always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice
soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.

The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling
all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short  for some way of escape, and wondering whether she
could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious
appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after
watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said
to herself â€œItâ€™s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk
to.â€

â€œHow are you getting on?â€ said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth
enough for it to speak with.

Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. ly one canâ€™t hear
oneself speakâ€”and they donâ€™t seem to have any rules in particular; at
least, if there are, nobody attends to themâ€”and youâ€™ve no idea how
confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, thereâ€™s the
arch Iâ€™ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the
groundâ€”and I should have croqueted the Queenâ€™s hedgehog just now, only
it ran away when it saw mine coming!â€

â€œHow do you like the Queen?â€ said the Cat in a low voice.

âe look of it at all,â€ said the King: â€œhowever, it may
kiss my hand if it likes.â€

â€œIâ€™d rather not,â€ the Cat remarked.

â€œDonâ€™t be impertinent,â€ said the King, â€œand donâ€™t look at me like
that!â€ He got behind Alice as he spoke.

â€œA cat may look at a king,â€ said Alice. â€œIâ€™ve read that in some book,
but I donâ€™t remember where.â€

â€œWell, it must be removed,â€ said the King very decidedly, and he called
the Queen, who was passing at the moment, â€œMy deuted for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look
of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew
whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.

The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed
to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the
other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to
the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a
helprowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between
the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,
while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.

The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle
the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they
all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly
what they said.

The executionerâ€™s argument was, that you couldnâ€™t cut o.)

Alice could think of nothing else to say but â€œIt belongs to the
Duchess: youâ€™d better ask _her_ about it.â€

â€œSheâ€™s in prison,â€ the Queen said to the executioner: â€œfetch her here.â€
And the executioner went off like an arrow.

The Catâ€™s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the
time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so
the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it,
while the rest of the party went hopeful
tone though), â€œI wonâ€™t have any pepper in my kitchen _at all_. Soup
does very well withoutâ€”Maybe itâ€™s always pepper that makes people
hot-tempered,â€ she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new
kind of rule, â€œand vinegar that makes them sourâ€”and camomile that makes
them bitterâ€”andâ€”and barley-sugar and such things that make children
sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew _that_: then they wouldnâ€™t be
so stingy about it, you knowâ€”â€

She had quide as
she spoke.

Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the
Duchess was _very_ ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the
right height to rest her chin upon Aliceâ€™s shoulder, and it was an
uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she
bore it as well as she could.

â€œThe gameâ€™s going on rather better now,â€ she said, by way of keeping up
the conversation a little.

â€œâ€™Tis so,â€ said the Duchess: â€œand the moral of thato
herself.

â€œI dare say youâ€™re wondering why I donâ€™t put my arm round your waist,â€
the Duchess said after a pause: â€œthe reason is, that Iâ€™m doubtful about
the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?â€

â€œHe might bite,â€ Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious
to have the experiment tried.

â€œVery true,â€ said the Duchess: â€œflamingoes and mustard both bite. And
the moral of that isâ€”â€˜Birds of a feather flock together.â€™â€

â€œOnly m
remark, â€œitâ€™s a vegetable. It doesnâ€™t look like one, but it is.â€

â€œI quite agree with you,â€ said the Duchess; â€œand the moral of that
isâ€”â€˜Be what you would seem to beâ€™â€”or if youâ€™d like it put more
simplyâ€”â€˜Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might
appear to others that what you were or might have been was not
otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be
otherwise.â€™â€

â€œI think I should understand that better,â€ Aesents like that!â€ But she did not venture to say it out
loud.

â€œThinking again?â€ the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp
little chin.

â€œIâ€™ve a right to think,â€ said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to
feel a little worried.

â€œJust about as much right,â€ said the Duchess, â€œas pigs have to fly; and
the mâ€”â€

But here, to Aliceâ€™s great surprise, the Duchessâ€™s voice died away,
even in the middle of her favourite word â€˜moral,â€™ and the arm that wa the game,â€ the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too
much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the
croquet-ground.

The other guests had taken advantage of the Queenâ€™s absence, and were
resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried
back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a momentâ€™s delay
would cost them their lives.

All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling
with the other players, and shouting â€œO even know what a Mock Turtle is.â€

â€œItâ€™s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,â€ said the Queen.

â€œI never saw one, or heard of one,â€ said Alice.

â€œCome on, then,â€ said the Queen, â€œand he shall tell you his history.â€

As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,
to the company generally, â€œYou are all pardoned.â€ â€œCome, _thatâ€™s_ a
good thing!â€ she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the
number of executions the Quetay with it
as to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.

The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till
she was out of sight: then it chuckled. â€œWhat fun!â€ said the Gryphon,
half to itself, half to Alice.

â€œWhat _is_ the fun?â€ said Alice.

â€œWhy, _she_,â€ said the Gryphon. â€œItâ€™s all her fancy, that: they never
executes nobody, you know. Come on!â€

â€œEverybody says â€˜come on!â€™ here,â€ thought Alice, as she went slowly
after it: â€œI nup to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes
full of tears, but said nothing.

â€œThis here young lady,â€ said the Gryphon, â€œshe wants for to know your
history, she do.â€

â€œIâ€™ll tell it her,â€ said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: â€œsit
down, both of you, and donâ€™t speak a word till Iâ€™ve finished.â€

So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to
herself, â€œI donâ€™t see how he can _ever_ finish, if he doesnâ€™t begin.â€
But n we were little,â€ the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,
though still sobbing a little now and then, â€œwe went to school in the
sea. The master was an old Turtleâ€”we used to call him Tortoiseâ€”â€

â€œWhy did you call him Tortoise, if he wasnâ€™t one?â€ Alice asked.

â€œWe called him Tortoise because he taught us,â€ said the Mock Turtle
angrily: â€œreally you are very dull!â€

â€œYou ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple
question,â€ added the Gryphonent on.

â€œWe had the best of educationsâ€”in fact, we went to school every dayâ€”â€

â€œ_Iâ€™ve_ been to a day-school, too,â€ said Alice; â€œyou neednâ€™t be so
proud as all that.â€

â€œWith extras?â€ asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.

â€œYes,â€ said Alice, â€œwe learned French and music.â€

â€œAnd washing?â€ said the Mock Turtle.

â€œCertainly not!â€ said Alice indignantly.

â€œAh! then yours wasnâ€™t a really good school,â€ said the Mock Turtle in a
tone of gition,
Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.â€

â€œI never heard of â€˜Uglification,â€™â€ Alice ventured to say. â€œWhat is it?â€

The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. â€œWhat! Never heard of
uglifying!â€ it exclaimed. â€œYou know what to beautify is, I suppose?â€

â€œYes,â€ said Alice doubtfully: â€œit meansâ€”toâ€”makeâ€”anythingâ€”prettier.â€

â€œWell, then,â€ the Gryphon went on, â€œif you donâ€™t know what to uglify
is, you _are_ a simpleton.â€

Alice di, I canâ€™t show it you myself,â€ the Mock Turtle said: â€œIâ€™m too
stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.â€

â€œHadnâ€™t time,â€ said the Gryphon: â€œI went to the Classics master,
though. He was an old crab, _he_ was.â€

â€œI never went to him,â€ the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: â€œhe taught
Laughing and Grief, they used to say.â€

â€œSo he did, so he did,â€ said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both
creatures hid their faces in their paws.

â€œAnd how many hours a dcourse it was,â€ said the Mock Turtle.

â€œAnd how did you manage on the twelfth?â€ Alice went on eagerly.

â€œThatâ€™s enough about lessons,â€ the Gryphon interrupted in a very
decided tone: â€œtell her something about the games now.â€




CHAPTER X.
The Lobster Quadrille


The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across
his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or
two sobs choked his voice. â€œSame as if he had a bone in his t thing a
Lobster Quadrille is!â€

â€œNo, indeed,â€ said Alice. â€œWhat sort of a dance is it?â€

â€œWhy,â€ said the Gryphon, â€œyou first form into a line along the
sea-shoreâ€”â€

â€œTwo lines!â€ cried the Mock Turtle. â€œSeals, turtles, salmon, and so on;
then, when youâ€™ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the wayâ€”â€

â€œ_That_ generally takes some time,â€ interrupted the Gryphon.

â€œâ€”you advance twiceâ€”â€

â€œEach with a lobster as a partner!â€ cried the Gryphobsters again!â€ yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.

â€œBack to land again, and thatâ€™s all the first figure,â€ said the Mock
Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had
been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very
sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.

â€œIt must be a very pretty dance,â€ said Alice timidly.

â€œWould you like to see a little of it?â€ said the Mock Turtle.

â€œVery much indeed,â€ said Alice.

â€œCome a snail.
â€œThereâ€™s a porpoise close behind us, and heâ€™s treading on my tail.
See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!
They are waiting on the shingleâ€”will you come and join the dance?
Will you, wonâ€™t you, will you, wonâ€™t you, will you join the dance?
Will you, wonâ€™t you, will you, wonâ€™t you, wonâ€™t you join the dance?

â€œYou can really have no notion how delightful it will be
When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!â€
But the ome and join the dance.
Will you, wonâ€™t you, will you, wonâ€™t you, will you join the dance?
Will you, wonâ€™t you, will you, wonâ€™t you, wonâ€™t you join the dance?â€


â€œThank you, itâ€™s a very interesting dance to watch,â€ said Alice,
feeling very glad that it was over at last: â€œand I do so like that
curious song about the whiting!â€

â€œOh, as to the whiting,â€ said the Mock Turtle, â€œtheyâ€”youâ€™ve seen them,
of course?â€

â€œYes,â€ said Alice, â€œIâ€™ve often seeâ€ here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his
eyes.â€”â€œTell her about the reason and all that,â€ he said to the Gryphon.

â€œThe reason is,â€ said the Gryphon, â€œthat they _would_ go with the
lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to
fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they
couldnâ€™t get them out again. Thatâ€™s all.â€

â€œThank you,â€ said Alice, â€œitâ€™s very interesting. I never knew so much
about a whiting before.â€
d a little before she gave her
answer. â€œTheyâ€™re done with blacking, I believe.â€

â€œBoots and shoes under the sea,â€ the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,
â€œare done with a whiting. Now you know.â€

â€œAnd what are they made of?â€ Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.

â€œSoles and eels, of course,â€ the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:
â€œany shrimp could have told you that.â€

â€œIf Iâ€™d been the whiting,â€ said Alice, whose thoughts were still
running on the soaid Alice.

â€œI mean what I say,â€ the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And
the Gryphon added â€œCome, letâ€™s hear some of _your_ adventures.â€

â€œI could tell you my adventuresâ€”beginning from this morning,â€ said
Alice a little timidly: â€œbut itâ€™s no use going back to yesterday,
because I was a different person then.â€

â€œExplain all that,â€ said the Mock Turtle.

â€œNo, no! The adventures first,â€ said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:
â€œexplanations take sun the Mock
Turtle drew a long breath, and said â€œThatâ€™s very curious.â€

â€œItâ€™s all about as curious as it can be,â€ said the Gryphon.

â€œIt all came different!â€ the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. â€œI
should like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to
begin.â€ He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of
authority over Alice.

â€œStand up and repeat â€˜â€™_Tis the voice of the sluggard_,â€™â€ said the
Gryphon.

â€œHow the creatures oout his toes.â€

[later editions continued as follows
When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,
And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,
But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,
His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]


â€œThatâ€™s different from what _I_ used to say when I was a child,â€ said
the Gryphon.

â€œWell, I never heard it before,â€ said the Mock Turtle; â€œbut it sounds
uncommon nonsense.â€

Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her fa.

â€œGo on with the next verse,â€ the Gryphon repeated impatiently: â€œit
begins â€˜_I passed by his garden_.â€™â€

Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come
wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:â€”

â€œI passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,
How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pieâ€”â€

[later editions continued as follows
The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,
While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.
Wer figure of the Lobster Quadrille?â€ the Gryphon
went on. â€œOr would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?â€

â€œOh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,â€ Alice
replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,
â€œHm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her â€˜_Turtle Soup_,â€™ will you, old
fellow?â€

The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked
with sobs, to sing this:â€”

â€œBeautiful Soup, so rich and green,
Waâ€”oop!
Sooâ€”oop of the eâ€”eâ€”evening,
    Beautiful, beautiâ€”FUL SOUP!â€


â€œChorus again!â€ cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun
to repeat it, when a cry of â€œThe trialâ€™s beginning!â€ was heard in the
distance.

â€œCome on!â€ cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried
off, without waiting for the end of the song.

â€œWhat trial is it?â€ Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only
answered â€œCome on!â€ and ran the faster, while mo; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one
hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the
court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so
good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at themâ€”â€œI wish theyâ€™d
get the trial done,â€ she thought, â€œand hand round the refreshments!â€
But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at
everything about her, to pass away the time.

Alice had never been in nd those twelve creatures,â€
(she was obliged to say â€œcreatures,â€ you see, because some of them were
animals, and some were birds,) â€œI suppose they are the jurors.â€ She
said this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather
proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little
girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, â€œjury-menâ€
would have done just as well.

The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. â€œWhat are
thewas talking.

Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,
that all the jurors were writing down â€œstupid things!â€ on their slates,
and she could even make out that one of them didnâ€™t know how to spell
â€œstupid,â€ and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. â€œA nice
muddle their slatesâ€™ll be in before the trialâ€™s over!â€ thought Alice.

One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice
could _not_ stand, and she went round thn
unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:â€”

â€œThe Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,
    All on a summer day:
The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,
    And took them quite away!â€


â€œConsider your verdict,â€ the King said to the jury.

â€œNot yet, not yet!â€ the Rabbit hastily interrupted. â€œThereâ€™s a great
deal to come before that!â€

â€œCall the first witness,â€ said the King; and the White Rabbit blew
three blasts on the trumpet, and called out,was,â€ he said.

â€œFifteenth,â€ said the March Hare.

â€œSixteenth,â€ added the Dormouse.

â€œWrite that down,â€ the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly
wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and
reduced the answer to shillings and pence.

â€œTake off your hat,â€ the King said to the Hatter.

â€œIt isnâ€™t mine,â€ said the Hatter.

â€œ_Stolen!_â€ the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made
a memorandum of the fact.

â€e out of his teacup instead of the
bread-and-butter.

Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled
her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to
grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave
the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was
as long as there was room for her.

â€œI wish you wouldnâ€™t squeeze so.â€ said the Dormouse, who was sitting
next to her. â€œI can hardly breathe.â€

mouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers
of the court, â€œBring me the list of the singers in the last concert!â€
on which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes
off.

â€œGive your evidence,â€ the King repeated angrily, â€œor Iâ€™ll have you
executed, whether youâ€™re nervous or not.â€

â€œIâ€™m a poor man, your Majesty,â€ the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,
â€œâ€”and I hadnâ€™t begun my teaâ€”not above a week or soâ€”and what with the
bretter.

â€œI deny it!â€ said the March Hare.

â€œHe denies it,â€ said the King: â€œleave out that part.â€

â€œWell, at any rate, the Dormouse saidâ€”â€ the Hatter went on, looking
anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied
nothing, being fast asleep.

â€œAfter that,â€ continued the Hatter, â€œI cut some more bread-and-butterâ€”â€

â€œBut what did the Dormouse say?â€ one of the jury asked.

â€œThat I canâ€™t remember,â€ said the Hatter.

â€œYou he mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,
head first, and then sat upon it.)

â€œIâ€™m glad Iâ€™ve seen that done,â€ thought Alice. â€œIâ€™ve so often read in
the newspapers, at the end of trials, â€œThere was some attempts at
applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the
court,â€ and I never understood what it meant till now.â€

â€œIf thatâ€™s all you know about it, you may stand down,â€ continued the
King.

â€œI canâ€™t go no lower,â€ sain.

â€œâ€”and just take his head off outside,â€ the Queen added to one of the
officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get
to the door.

â€œCall the next witness!â€ said the King.

The next witness was the Duchessâ€™s cook. She carried the pepper-box in
her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the
court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.

â€œGive your evidence,â€ said the King.

â€œShanâ€™t,â€ said d out. â€œBehead that Dormouse!
Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his
whiskers!â€

For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse
turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had
disappeared.

â€œNever mind!â€ said the King, with an air of great relief. â€œCall the
next witness.â€ And he added in an undertone to the Queen, â€œReally, my
dear, _you_ must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my
utes, and she jumped up in such
a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,
upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there
they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of
goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before.

â€œOh, I _beg_ your pardon!â€ she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and
began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident
of the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had  being quite unable to move. She soon
got it out again, and put it right; â€œnot that it signifies much,â€ she
said to herself; â€œI should think it would be _quite_ as much use in the
trial one way up as the other.â€

As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being
upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to
them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the
accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to n a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as
he spoke.

â€œ_Un_important, of course, I meant,â€ the King hastily said, and went on
to himself in an undertone,

â€œimportantâ€”unimportantâ€”unimportantâ€”importantâ€”â€ as if he were trying
which word sounded best.

Some of the jury wrote it down â€œimportant,â€ and some â€œunimportant.â€
Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;
â€œbut it doesnâ€™t matter a bit,â€ she thought to ht just now.â€

â€œItâ€™s the oldest rule in the book,â€ said the King.

â€œThen it ought to be Number One,â€ said Alice.

The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. â€œConsider your
verdict,â€ he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.

â€œThereâ€™s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,â€ said the
White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; â€œthis paper has just been
picked up.â€

â€œWhatâ€™s in it?â€ said the Queen.

â€œI havenâ€™t opened it yet,âses.â€

â€œAre they in the prisonerâ€™s handwriting?â€ asked another of the jurymen.

â€œNo, theyâ€™re not,â€ said the White Rabbit, â€œand thatâ€™s the queerest
thing about it.â€ (The jury all looked puzzled.)

â€œHe must have imitated somebody elseâ€™s hand,â€ said the King. (The jury
all brightened up again.)

â€œPlease your Majesty,â€ said the Knave, â€œI didnâ€™t write it, and they
canâ€™t prove I did: thereâ€™s no name signed at the end.â€

â€œIf you didnâ€™t sign it,â€cles. â€œWhere shall I begin, please
your Majesty?â€ he asked.

â€œBegin at the beginning,â€ the King said gravely, â€œand go on till you
come to the end: then stop.â€

These were the verses the White Rabbit read:â€”

â€œThey told me you had been to her,
    And mentioned me to him:
She gave me a good character,
    But said I could not swim.

He sent them word I had not gone
    (We know it to be true):
If she should push the matter on,
    What would become of you?

I gaveBetween yourself and me.â€


â€œThatâ€™s the most important piece of evidence weâ€™ve heard yet,â€ said the
King, rubbing his hands; â€œso now let the juryâ€”â€

â€œIf any one of them can explain it,â€ said Alice, (she had grown so
large in the last few minutes that she wasnâ€™t a bit afraid of
interrupting him,) â€œIâ€™ll give him sixpence. _I_ donâ€™t believe thereâ€™s
an atom of meaning in it.â€

The jury all wrote down on their slates, â€œ_She_ doesnâ€™t believe thereâ€™s
an sadly. â€œDo I look like it?â€ he said. (Which he
certainly did _not_, being made entirely of cardboard.)

â€œAll right, so far,â€ said the King, and he went on muttering over the
verses to himself: â€œâ€˜_We know it to be true_â€”â€™ thatâ€™s the jury, of
courseâ€”â€˜_I gave her one, they gave him two_â€”â€™ why, that must be what he
did with the tarts, you knowâ€”â€

â€œBut, it goes on â€˜_they all returned from him to you_,â€™â€ said Alice.

â€œWhy, there they are!â€ said the 
as it lasted.)

â€œThen the words donâ€™t _fit_ you,â€ said the King, looking round the
court with a smile. There was a dead silence.

â€œItâ€™s a pun!â€ the King added in an offended tone, and everybody
laughed, â€œLet the jury consider their verdict,â€ the King said, for
about the twentieth time that day.

â€œNo, no!â€ said the Queen. â€œSentence firstâ€”verdict afterwards.â€

â€œStuff and nonsense!â€ said Alice loudly. â€œThe idea of having the
sentence first!â€

â€œHoldank, with her
head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead
leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.

â€œWake up, Alice dear!â€ said her sister; â€œWhy, what a long sleep youâ€™ve
had!â€

â€œOh, Iâ€™ve had such a curious dream!â€ said Alice, and she told her
sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange
Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she
had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, â€œId once again the tiny
hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were
looking up into hersâ€”she could hear the very tones of her voice, and
see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair
that _would_ always get into her eyesâ€”and still as she listened, or
seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the
strange creatures of her little sisterâ€™s dream.

The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried byâ€”the
frlled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock
Turtle.

So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in
Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all
would change to dull realityâ€”the grass would be only rustling in the
wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reedsâ€”the rattling
teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queenâ€™s shrill
cries to the voice of the shepherd boyâ€”and the sneeze of the baby, the
ittle children,
and make _their_ eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale,
perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she
would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all
their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer
days.
