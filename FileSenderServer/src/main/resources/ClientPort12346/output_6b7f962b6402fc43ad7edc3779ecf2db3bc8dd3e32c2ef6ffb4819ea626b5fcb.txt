                                  Ijudgements, a
habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me
the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to
detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal
person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of
being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild,
unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsoughtâ€”frequently I have
feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I reah.

And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission
that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the
wet marshes, but after a certain point I donâ€™t care what itâ€™s founded
on. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted
the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I
wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the
human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, wae temperamentâ€â€”it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a
romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and
which it is not likely I shall ever find again. Noâ€”Gatsby turned out
all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust
floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my
interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.

My family have berence to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in
fatherâ€™s office. I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of
a century after my father, and a little later I participated in that
delayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War. I enjoyed the
counter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being
the warm centre of the world, the Middle West now seemed like the
ragged edge of the universeâ€”so I decided to go East and learn the bond
business. Everybody I and friendly
trees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a
house together in a commuting town, it sounded like a great idea. He
found the house, a weather-beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a
month, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington, and
I went out to the country alone. I had a dogâ€”at least I had him for a
few days until he ran awayâ€”and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman, who
made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to
hmovies, I had that familiar
conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.

There was so much to read, for one thing, and so much fine health to
be pulled down out of the young breath-giving air. I bought a dozen
volumes on banking and credit and investment securities, and they
stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint,
promising to unfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and
Maecenas knew. And I had the high intention of reading many otrth America. It was on that slender
riotous island which extends itself due east of New Yorkâ€”and where
there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of
land. Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in
contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most
domesticated body of salt water in the Western hemisphere, the great
wet barnyard of Long Island Sound. They are not perfect ovalsâ€”like the
egg in the Columbus story, they are bhe Sound, and squeezed between two huge
places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one on
my right was a colossal affair by any standardâ€”it was a factual
imitation of some HÃ´tel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one
side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble
swimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. It was
Gatsbyâ€™s mansion. Or, rather, as I didnâ€™t know Mr. Gatsby, it was a
mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name.Iâ€™d known Tom
in college. And just after the war I spent two days with them in
Chicago.

Her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of
the most powerful ends that ever played football at New Havenâ€”a
national figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute
limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savours of
anticlimax. His family were enormously wealthyâ€”even in college his
freedom with money was a matter for reproachâ€”but now heâ€ I didnâ€™t believe
itâ€”I had no sight into Daisyâ€™s heart, but I felt that Tom would drift
on forever seeking, a little wistfully, for the dramatic turbulence of
some irrecoverable football game.

And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East
Egg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all. Their house
was even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red-and-white
Georgian Colonial mansion, overlooking the bay. The lawn started at
the beach and ran to
straw-haired man of thirty, with a rather hard mouth and a
supercilious manner. Two shining arrogant eyes had established
dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning
aggressively forward. Not even the effeminate swank of his riding
clothes could hide the enormous power of that bodyâ€”he seemed to fill
those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could
see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his
thin coat. It was a bte I
always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like
him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.

We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.

â€œIâ€™ve got a nice place here,â€ he said, his eyes flashing about
restlessly.

Turning me around by one arm, he moved a broad flat hand along the
front vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half
acre of deep, pungent roses, and a snub-nosed motorboat that bumped
the tide offshore.

â€e frosted wedding-cake of the
ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-coloured rug, making a shadow
on it as wind does on the sea.

The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous
couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an
anchored balloon. They were both in white, and their dresses were
rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a
short flight around the house. I must have stood for a few moments
listening to the whip andaw me out of the corner of her eyes
she gave no hint of itâ€”indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring
an apology for having disturbed her by coming in.

The other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to riseâ€”she leaned slightly
forward with a conscientious expressionâ€”then she laughed, an absurd,
charming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the
room.

â€œIâ€™m p-paralysed with happiness.â€

She laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my
hand fo was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her
something of a fright. Again a sort of apology arose to my lips.
Almost any exhibition of complete self-sufficiency draws a stunned
tribute from me.

I looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me questions in her low,
thrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and
down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be
played again. Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it,
brcally.

â€œThe whole town is desolate. All the cars have the left rear wheel
painted black as a mourning wreath, and thereâ€™s a persistent wail all
night along the north shore.â€

â€œHow gorgeous! Letâ€™s go back, Tom. Tomorrow!â€ Then she added
irrelevantly: â€œYou ought to see the baby.â€

â€œIâ€™d like to.â€

â€œSheâ€™s asleep. Sheâ€™s three years old. Havenâ€™t you ever seen her?â€

â€œNever.â€

â€œWell, you ought to see her. Sheâ€™sâ€”â€

Tom Buchanan, who had been ol to live anywhere else.â€

At this point Miss Baker said: â€œAbsolutely!â€ with such suddenness that
I startedâ€”it was the first word she had uttered since I came into the
room. Evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned
and with a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.

â€œIâ€™m stiff,â€ she complained, â€œIâ€™ve been lying on that sofa for as long
as I can remember.â€

â€œDonâ€™t look at me,â€ Daisy retorted, â€œIâ€™ve been trying to get ich she accentuated by throwing her body backward
at the shoulders like a young cadet. Her grey sun-strained eyes looked
back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming,
discontented face. It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a
picture of her, somewhere before.

â€œYou live in West Egg,â€ she remarked contemptuously. â€œI know somebody
there.â€

â€œI donâ€™t know a singleâ€”â€

â€œYou must know Gatsby.â€

â€œGatsby?â€ demanded Daisy. â€œWhat Gatsby?âhem out with her
fingers. â€œIn two weeks itâ€™ll be the longest day in the year.â€ She
looked at us all radiantly. â€œDo you always watch for the longest day
of the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in
the year and then miss it.â€

â€œWe ought to plan something,â€ yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the
table as if she were getting into bed.

â€œAll right,â€ said Daisy. â€œWhatâ€™ll we plan?â€ She turned to me
helplessly: â€œWhat do people plan?â€

BeforDaisy.

Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a
bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool
as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all
desire. They were here, and they accepted Tom and me, making only a
polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained. They knew
that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too
would be over and casually put away. It was sharply different frontly. â€œIâ€™ve
gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you read The Rise
of the Coloured Empires by this man Goddard?â€

â€œWhy, no,â€ I answered, rather surprised by his tone.

â€œWell, itâ€™s a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is
if we donâ€™t look out the white race will beâ€”will be utterly
submerged. Itâ€™s all scientific stuff; itâ€™s been proved.â€

â€œTomâ€™s getting very profound,â€ said Daisy, with an expression of
unthoughtful sadness. ânterrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair.

â€œThis idea is that weâ€™re Nordics. I am, and you are, and you are,
andâ€”â€ After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a
slight nod, and she winked at me again. â€œâ€”And weâ€™ve produced all the
things that go to make civilizationâ€”oh, science and art, and all
that. Do you see?â€

There was something pathetic in his concentration, as if his
complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more.
When, aople. He had to polish it from morning till night, until finally it
began to affect his noseâ€”â€

â€œThings went from bad to worse,â€ suggested Miss Baker.

â€œYes. Things went from bad to worse, until finally he had to give up
his position.â€

For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her
glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I
listenedâ€”then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering
regret, like children leaving a plea like a rose. She was only
extemporizing, but a stirring warmth flowed from her, as if her heart
was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless,
thrilling words. Then suddenly she threw her napkin on the table and
excused herself and went into the house.

Miss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of
meaning. I was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said â€œSh!â€
in a warning voice. A subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the
room beyonesitantly. â€œTomâ€™s got some woman in New York.â€

â€œGot some woman?â€ I repeated blankly.

Miss Baker nodded.

â€œShe might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time.
Donâ€™t you think?â€

Almost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a
dress and the crunch of leather boots, and Tom and Daisy were back at
the table.

â€œIt couldnâ€™t be helped!â€ cried Daisy with tense gaiety.

She sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me, anly at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects,
vanished into air. Among the broken fragments of the last five minutes
at table I remember the candles being lit again, pointlessly, and I
was conscious of wanting to look squarely at everyone, and yet to
avoid all eyes. I couldnâ€™t guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking, but
I doubt if even Miss Baker, who seemed to have mastered a certain
hardy scepticism, was able utterly to put this fifth guestâ€™s shrill
metallic urgency ous deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee.

Daisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its lovely shape, and
her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. I saw that
turbulent emotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be
some sedative questions about her little girl.

â€œWe donâ€™t know each other very well, Nick,â€ she said suddenly. â€œEven
if we are cousins. You didnâ€™t come to my wedding.â€

â€œI wasnâ€™t back from the war.â€

â€œThatâ€™sw you how Iâ€™ve gotten to feel aboutâ€”things. Well, she was
less than an hour old and Tom was God knows where. I woke up out of
the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling, and asked the nurse right
away if it was a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and so I
turned my head away and wept. â€˜All right,â€™ I said, â€˜Iâ€™m glad itâ€™s a
girl. And I hope sheâ€™ll be a foolâ€”thatâ€™s the best thing a girl can be
in this world, a beautiful little fool.â€™

â€œYou see I think everytas though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to
exact a contributory emotion from me. I waited, and sure enough, in a
moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face, as
if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret
society to which she and Tom belonged.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Inside, the crimson room bloomed with light. Tom and Miss Baker sat at
either end of the long couch and she tself with a restless movement of her knee, and she
stood up.

â€œTen oâ€™clock,â€ she remarked, apparently finding the time on the
ceiling. â€œTime for this good girl to go to bed.â€

â€œJordanâ€™s going to play in the tournament tomorrow,â€ explained Daisy,
â€œover at Westchester.â€

â€œOhâ€”youâ€™re Jordan Baker.â€

I knew now why her face was familiarâ€”its pleasing contemptuous
expression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of the
sporting life at Ashevilley in linen closets and push
you out to sea in a boat, and all that sort of thingâ€”â€

â€œGood night,â€ called Miss Baker from the stairs. â€œI havenâ€™t heard a
word.â€

â€œSheâ€™s a nice girl,â€ said Tom after a moment. â€œThey oughtnâ€™t to let
her run around the country this way.â€

â€œWho oughtnâ€™t to?â€ inquired Daisy coldly.

â€œHer family.â€

â€œHer family is one aunt about a thousand years old. Besides, Nickâ€™s
going to look after her, arenâ€™t you, Nick? Sheâ€™s ked about the Nordic race. Yes, Iâ€™m sure we did. It sort of crept
up on us and first thing you knowâ€”â€

â€œDonâ€™t believe everything you hear, Nick,â€ he advised me.

I said lightly that I had heard nothing at all, and a few minutes
later I got up to go home. They came to the door with me and stood
side by side in a cheerful square of light. As I started my motor
Daisy peremptorily called: â€œWait!

â€œI forgot to ask you something, and itâ€™s important. We heard you were
engagop going with an old
friend on account of rumours, and on the other hand I had no intention
of being rumoured into marriage.

Their interest rather touched me and made them less remotely
richâ€”nevertheless, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove
away. It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out
of the house, child in armsâ€”but apparently there were no such
intentions in her head. As for Tom, the fact that he â€œhad some woman
in New Yorkâ€ was really lessoud, bright night, with wings beating in the
trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth
blew the frogs full of life. The silhouette of a moving cat wavered
across the moonlight, and, turning my head to watch it, I saw that I
was not aloneâ€”fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of
my neighbourâ€™s mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets
regarding the silver pepper of the stars. Something in his leisurely
movements and the secure positeawardâ€”and distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute
and far away, that might have been the end of a dock. When I looked
once more for Gatsby he had vanished, and I was alone again in the
unquiet darkness.


                                  II

About halfway between West Egg and New York the motor road hastily
joins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile, so as
to shrink away from a certain desolate area of land. This is a valley
of ashesâ€”a fantasheir obscure operations from your sight.

But above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift
endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T.
J. Eckleburg. The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and
giganticâ€”their retinas are one yard high. They look out of no face,
but, instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass
over a nonexistent nose. Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set
them there to fatten his practice in the borough of this that I first met Tom Buchananâ€™s mistress.

The fact that he had one was insisted upon wherever he was known. His
acquaintances resented the fact that he turned up in popular cafÃ©s
with her and, leaving her at a table, sauntered about, chatting with
whomsoever he knew. Though I was curious to see her, I had no desire
to meet herâ€”but I did. I went up to New York with Tom on the train one
afternoon, and when we stopped by the ash-heaps he jumped to his feet
and, taking hold ofsight was a small block of
yellow brick sitting on the edge of the waste land, a sort of compact
Main Street ministering to it, and contiguous to absolutely nothing.
One of the three shops it contained was for rent and another was an
all-night restaurant, approached by a trail of ashes; the third was a
garageâ€”Repairs. George B. Wilson. Cars bought and sold.â€”and I followed
Tom inside.

The interior was unprosperous and bare; the only car visible was the
dust-covered wreck of a Ford wbusiness?â€

â€œI canâ€™t complain,â€ answered Wilson unconvincingly. â€œWhen are you
going to sell me that car?â€

â€œNext week; Iâ€™ve got my man working on it now.â€

â€œWorks pretty slow, donâ€™t he?â€

â€œNo, he doesnâ€™t,â€ said Tom coldly. â€œAnd if you feel that way about it,
maybe Iâ€™d better sell it somewhere else after all.â€

â€œI donâ€™t mean that,â€ explained Wilson quickly. â€œI just meantâ€”â€

His voice faded off and Tom glanced impatiently around the garrough her husband as if he were a ghost, shook hands with Tom,
looking him flush in the eye. Then she wet her lips, and without
turning around spoke to her husband in a soft, coarse voice:

â€œGet some chairs, why donâ€™t you, so somebody can sit down.â€

â€œOh, sure,â€ agreed Wilson hurriedly, and went toward the little
office, mingling immediately with the cement colour of the walls. A
white ashen dust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled
everything in the vicinityâ€”â€œTerrible place, isnâ€™t it,â€ said Tom, exchanging a frown with Doctor
Eckleburg.

â€œAwful.â€

â€œIt does her good to get away.â€

â€œDoesnâ€™t her husband object?â€

â€œWilson? He thinks she goes to see her sister in New York. Heâ€™s so
dumb he doesnâ€™t know heâ€™s alive.â€

So Tom Buchanan and his girl and I went up together to New Yorkâ€”or not
quite together, for Mrs. Wilson sat discreetly in another car. Tom
deferred that much to the sensibilities of those East Eggerslid out from
the mass of the station into the glowing sunshine. But immediately she
turned sharply from the window and, leaning forward, tapped on the
front glass.

â€œI want to get one of those dogs,â€ she said earnestly. â€œI want to get
one for the apartment. Theyâ€™re nice to haveâ€”a dog.â€

We backed up to a grey old man who bore an absurd resemblance to John
D. Rockefeller. In a basket swung from his neck cowered a dozen very
recent puppies of an indeterminate breed.

â€œWhredale.â€ He passed his hand over the
brown washrag of a back. â€œLook at that coat. Some coat. Thatâ€™s a dog
thatâ€™ll never bother you with catching cold.â€

â€œI think itâ€™s cute,â€ said Mrs. Wilson enthusiastically. â€œHow much is
it?â€

â€œThat dog?â€ He looked at it admiringly. â€œThat dog will cost you ten
dollars.â€

The Airedaleâ€”undoubtedly there was an Airedale concerned in it
somewhere, though its feet were startlingly whiteâ€”changed hands and
settled down into o leave you here.â€

â€œNo you donâ€™t,â€ interposed Tom quickly. â€œMyrtleâ€™ll be hurt if you
donâ€™t come up to the apartment. Wonâ€™t you, Myrtle?â€

â€œCome on,â€ she urged. â€œIâ€™ll telephone my sister Catherine. Sheâ€™s said
to be very beautiful by people who ought to know.â€

â€œWell, Iâ€™d like to, butâ€”â€

We went on, cutting back again over the Park toward the West Hundreds.
At 158th Street the cab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of
apartment-houses. Throt, so that to move about was to stumble continually over scenes of
ladies swinging in the gardens of Versailles. The only picture was an
over-enlarged photograph, apparently a hen sitting on a blurred rock.
Looked at from a distance, however, the hen resolved itself into a
bonnet, and the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down into the
room. Several old copies of Town Tattle lay on the table together with
a copy of Simon Called Peter, and some of the small scandal magazines
of Broadwuntil after eight oâ€™clock the apartment was full of cheerful
sun. Sitting on Tomâ€™s lap Mrs. Wilson called up several people on the
telephone; then there were no cigarettes, and I went out to buy some
at the drugstore on the corner. When I came back they had both
disappeared, so I sat down discreetly in the living-room and read a
chapter of Simon Called Peterâ€”either it was terrible stuff or the
whisky distorted things, because it didnâ€™t make any sense to me.

Just as Tom and Myrtlthere was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets
jingled up and down upon her arms. She came in with such a proprietary
haste, and looked around so possessively at the furniture that I
wondered if she lived here. But when I asked her she laughed
immoderately, repeated my question aloud, and told me she lived with a
girl friend at a hotel.

Mr. McKee was a pale, feminine man from the flat below. He had just
shaved, for there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone, andtime before, and was now
attired in an elaborate afternoon dress of cream-coloured chiffon,
which gave out a continual rustle as she swept about the room. With
the influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a
change. The intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage
was converted into impressive hauteur. Her laughter, her gestures, her
assertions became more violently affected moment by moment, and as she
expanded the room grew smaller around her, until she see
â€œI like your dress,â€ remarked Mrs. McKee, â€œI think itâ€™s adorable.â€

Mrs. Wilson rejected the compliment by raising her eyebrow in disdain.

â€œItâ€™s just a crazy old thing,â€ she said. â€œI just slip it on sometimes
when I donâ€™t care what I look like.â€

â€œBut it looks wonderful on you, if you know what I mean,â€ pursued Mrs.
McKee. â€œIf Chester could only get you in that pose I think he could
make something of it.â€

We all looked in silence at Mrs. Wilson, who reid â€œSh!â€ and we all looked at the subject again,
whereupon Tom Buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet.

â€œYou McKees have something to drink,â€ he said. â€œGet some more ice and
mineral water, Myrtle, before everybody goes to sleep.â€

â€œI told that boy about the ice.â€ Myrtle raised her eyebrows in despair
at the shiftlessness of the lower orders. â€œThese people! You have to
keep after them all the time.â€

She looked at me and laughed pointlessly. Then she flounced ove down on Long Island, too?â€ she inquired.

â€œI live at West Egg.â€

â€œReally? I was down there at a party about a month ago. At a man named
Gatsbyâ€™s. Do you know him?â€

â€œI live next door to him.â€

â€œWell, they say heâ€™s a nephew or a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelmâ€™s. Thatâ€™s
where all his money comes from.â€

â€œReally?â€

She nodded.

â€œIâ€™m scared of him. Iâ€™d hate to have him get anything on me.â€

This absorbing information about my neighbour was interrupMyrtle?â€

â€œDo what?â€ she asked, startled.

â€œYouâ€™ll give McKee a letter of introduction to your husband, so he can
do some studies of him.â€ His lips moved silently for a moment as he
invented, â€œâ€Šâ€˜George B. Wilson at the Gasoline Pump,â€™ or something like
that.â€

Catherine leaned close to me and whispered in my ear:

â€œNeither of them can stand the person theyâ€™re married to.â€

â€œCanâ€™t they?â€

â€œCanâ€™t stand them.â€ She looked at Myrtle and then at Teve in divorce.â€

Daisy was not a Catholic, and I was a little shocked at the
elaborateness of the lie.

â€œWhen they do get married,â€ continued Catherine, â€œtheyâ€™re going West
to live for a while until it blows over.â€

â€œItâ€™d be more discreet to go to Europe.â€

â€œOh, do you like Europe?â€ she exclaimed surprisingly. â€œI just got back
from Monte Carlo.â€

â€œReally.â€

â€œJust last year. I went over there with another girl.â€

â€œStay long?â€

â€œNo, we ju â€œI almost
married a little kike whoâ€™d been after me for years. I knew he was
below me. Everybody kept saying to me: â€˜Lucille, that manâ€™s way below
you!â€™ But if I hadnâ€™t met Chester, heâ€™d of got me sure.â€

â€œYes, but listen,â€ said Myrtle Wilson, nodding her head up and down,
â€œat least you didnâ€™t marry him.â€

â€œI know I didnâ€™t.â€

â€œWell, I married him,â€ said Myrtle, ambiguously. â€œAnd thatâ€™s the
difference between your case and mine.â€

â€œWhy diddenly at me, and everyone looked at me accusingly. I
tried to show by my expression that I expected no affection.

â€œThe only crazy I was was when I married him. I knew right away I made
a mistake. He borrowed somebodyâ€™s best suit to get married in, and
never even told me about it, and the man came after it one day when he
was out: â€˜Oh, is that your suit?â€™ I said. â€˜This is the first I ever
heard about it.â€™ But I gave it to him and then I lay down and cried to
beat the band allward toward the park through the soft twilight,
but each time I tried to go I became entangled in some wild, strident
argument which pulled me back, as if with ropes, into my chair. Yet
high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed
their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening
streets, and I saw him too, looking up and wondering. I was within and
without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible
variety of life.

Myrtle pulleon he was next to me, and his white
shirtfront pressed against my arm, and so I told him Iâ€™d have to call
a policeman, but he knew I lied. I was so excited that when I got into
a taxi with him I didnâ€™t hardly know I wasnâ€™t getting into a subway
train. All I kept thinking about, over and over, was â€˜You canâ€™t live
forever; you canâ€™t live forever.â€™â€Šâ€

She turned to Mrs. McKee and the room rang full of her artificial
laughter.

â€œMy dear,â€ she cried, â€œIâ€™m going to d at my watch
and found it was ten. Mr. McKee was asleep on a chair with his fists
clenched in his lap, like a photograph of a man of action. Taking out
my handkerchief I wiped from his cheek the spot of dried lather that
had worried me all the afternoon.

The little dog was sitting on the table looking with blind eyes
through the smoke, and from time to time groaning faintly. People
disappeared, reappeared, made plans to go somewhere, and then lost
each other, searched for each other, he confusion a long broken wail of
pain. Mr. McKee awoke from his doze and started in a daze toward the
door. When he had gone halfway he turned around and stared at the
sceneâ€”his wife and Catherine scolding and consoling as they stumbled
here and there among the crowded furniture with articles of aid, and
the despairing figure on the couch, bleeding fluently, and trying to
spread a copy of Town Tattle over the tapestry scenes of
Versailles. Then Mr. McKee turned and continued on out thth a great portfolio in his hands.

â€œBeauty and the Beast â€¦ Loneliness â€¦ Old Grocery Horse â€¦ Brookâ€™n
Bridge â€¦â€

Then I was lying half asleep in the cold lower level of the
Pennsylvania Station, staring at the morning Tribune, and waiting for
the four oâ€™clock train.


                                 III

There was music from my neighbourâ€™s house through the summer nights.
In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the
whisperings and the chamts, including an extra
gardener, toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes and hammers
and garden-shears, repairing the ravages of the night before.

Every Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a
fruiterer in New Yorkâ€”every Monday these same oranges and lemons left
his back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves. There was a machine in
the kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in
half an hour if a little button was pressed two hundred times by forgotten that
most of his female guests were too young to know one from another.

By seven oâ€™clock the orchestra has arrived, no thin five-piece affair,
but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and
cornets and piccolos, and low and high drums. The last swimmers have
come in from the beach now and are dressing upstairs; the cars from
New York are parked five deep in the drive, and already the halls and
salons and verandas are gaudy with primary colours, and haes pitches a key higher. Laughter is easier minute by minute,
spilled with prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful word. The groups
change more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the
same breath; already there are wanderers, confident girls who weave
here and there among the stouter and more stable, become for a sharp,
joyous moment the centre of a group, and then, excited with triumph,
glide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and colour under
the constantly cne
of the few guests who had actually been invited. People were not
invitedâ€”they went there. They got into automobiles which bore them out
to Long Island, and somehow they ended up at Gatsbyâ€™s door. Once there
they were introduced by somebody who knew Gatsby, and after that they
conducted themselves according to the rules of behaviour associated
with an amusement park. Sometimes they came and went without having
met Gatsby at all, came for the party with a simplicity of heart that
wa up in white flannels I went over to his lawn a little after
seven, and wandered around rather ill at ease among swirls and eddies
of people I didnâ€™t knowâ€”though here and there was a face I had noticed
on the commuting train. I was immediately struck by the number of
young Englishmen dotted about; all well dressed, all looking a little
hungry, and all talking in low, earnest voices to solid and prosperous
Americans. I was sure that they were selling something: bonds or
insurance or aug
purposeless and alone.

I was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment when
Jordan Baker came out of the house and stood at the head of the marble
steps, leaning a little backward and looking with contemptuous
interest down into the garden.

Welcome or not, I found it necessary to attach myself to someone
before I should begin to address cordial remarks to the passersby.

â€œHello!â€ I roared, advancing toward her. My voice seemed unnaturally
loud across the garden.the girls in yellow, â€œbut we
met you here about a month ago.â€

â€œYouâ€™ve dyed your hair since then,â€ remarked Jordan, and I started,
but the girls had moved casually on and her remark was addressed to
the premature moon, produced like the supper, no doubt, out of a
catererâ€™s basket. With Jordanâ€™s slender golden arm resting in mine, we
descended the steps and sauntered about the garden. A tray of
cocktails floated at us through the twilight, and we sat down at a
table with th and
he asked me my name and addressâ€”inside of a week I got a package from
Croirierâ€™s with a new evening gown in it.â€

â€œDid you keep it?â€ asked Jordan.

â€œSure I did. I was going to wear it tonight, but it was too big in the
bust and had to be altered. It was gas blue with lavender beads. Two
hundred and sixty-five dollars.â€

â€œThereâ€™s something funny about a fellow thatâ€™ll do a thing like that,â€
said the other girl eagerly. â€œHe doesnâ€™t want any trouble with
aman who knew all about him, grew up with him in
Germany,â€ he assured us positively.

â€œOh, no,â€ said the first girl, â€œit couldnâ€™t be that, because he was in
the American army during the war.â€ As our credulity switched back to
her she leaned forward with enthusiasm. â€œYou look at him sometimes
when he thinks nobodyâ€™s looking at him. Iâ€™ll bet he killed a man.â€

She narrowed her eyes and shivered. Lucille shivered. We all turned
and looked around for Gatsby. It was testimhe impression that
sooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person to a
greater or lesser degree. Instead of rambling, this party had
preserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the function
of representing the staid nobility of the countrysideâ€”East Egg
condescending to West Egg and carefully on guard against its
spectroscopic gaiety.

â€œLetâ€™s get out,â€ whispered Jordan, after a somehow wasteful and
inappropriate half-hour; â€œthis is much too polite for  complete from some ruin overseas.

A stout, middle-aged man, with enormous owl-eyed spectacles, was
sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table, staring with
unsteady concentration at the shelves of books. As we entered he
wheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan from head to foot.

â€œWhat do you think?â€ he demanded impetuously.

â€œAbout what?â€

He waved his hand toward the bookshelves.

â€œAbout that. As a matter of fact you neednâ€™t bother to ascertain. I
asceâ€™s a
triumph. What thoroughness! What realism! Knew when to stop,
tooâ€”didnâ€™t cut the pages. But what do you want? What do you expect?â€

He snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf,
muttering that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable
to collapse.

â€œWho brought you?â€ he demanded. â€œOr did you just come? I was brought.
Most people were brought.â€

Jordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully, without answering.

â€œI was brought by a wome garden; old men pushing
young girls backward in eternal graceless circles, superior couples
holding each other tortuously, fashionably, and keeping in the
cornersâ€”and a great number of single girls dancing individually or
relieving the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or the
traps. By midnight the hilarity had increased. A celebrated tenor had
sung in Italian, and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz, and
between the numbers people were doing â€œstuntsâ€ all over tttle girl, who gave way upon the
slightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter. I was enjoying
myself now. I had taken two finger-bowls of champagne, and the scene
had changed before my eyes into something significant, elemental, and
profound.

At a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled.

â€œYour face is familiar,â€ he said politely. â€œWerenâ€™t you in the First
Division during the war?â€

â€œWhy yes. I was in the Twenty-eighth Infantry.â€

â€œI was in the
around and smiled.

â€œHaving a gay time now?â€ she inquired.

â€œMuch better.â€ I turned again to my new acquaintance. â€œThis is an
unusual party for me. I havenâ€™t even seen the host. I live over
thereâ€”â€ I waved my hand at the invisible hedge in the distance, â€œand
this man Gatsby sent over his chauffeur with an invitation.â€

For a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand.

â€œIâ€™m Gatsby,â€ he said suddenly.

â€œWhat!â€ I exclaimed. â€œOh, I beg your paieved in you as you
would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had
precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to
convey. Precisely at that point it vanishedâ€”and I was looking at an
elegant young roughneck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate
formality of speech just missed being absurd. Some time before he
introduced himself Iâ€™d got a strong impression that he was picking his
words with care.

Almost at the moment when Mr. Gatsby identified nded. â€œDo you know?â€

â€œHeâ€™s just a man named Gatsby.â€

â€œWhere is he from, I mean? And what does he do?â€

â€œNow youâ€™re started on the subject,â€ she answered with a wan smile.
â€œWell, he told me once he was an Oxford man.â€

A dim background started to take shape behind him, but at her next
remark it faded away.

â€œHowever, I donâ€™t believe it.â€

â€œWhy not?â€

â€œI donâ€™t know,â€ she insisted, â€œI just donâ€™t think he went there.â€

Something in heordan, changing the subject
with an urban distaste for the concrete. â€œAnd I like large parties.
Theyâ€™re so intimate. At small parties there isnâ€™t any privacy.â€

There was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice of the orchestra
leader rang out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden.

â€œLadies and gentlemen,â€ he cried. â€œAt the request of Mr. Gatsby we are
going to play for you Mr. Vladmir Tostoffâ€™s latest work, which
attracted so much attention at Carnegie Hall last May
was drawn attractively tight on his face and his short hair looked as
though it were trimmed every day. I could see nothing sinister about
him. I wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helped to set him
off from his guests, for it seemed to me that he grew more correct as
the fraternal hilarity increased. When the â€œJazz History of the Worldâ€
was over, girls were putting their heads on menâ€™s shoulders in a
puppyish, convivial way, girls were swooning backward playfully into
mShe got up slowly, raising her eyebrows at me in astonishment, and
followed the butler toward the house. I noticed that she wore her
evening-dress, all her dresses, like sports clothesâ€”there was a
jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to walk
upon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings.

I was alone and it was almost two. For some time confused and
intriguing sounds had issued from a long, many-windowed room which
overhung the terrace. Eluding Jordanâ€™s undergraduaer there was a pause in the song she filled it with
gasping, broken sobs, and then took up the lyric again in a quavering
soprano. The tears coursed down her cheeksâ€”not freely, however, for
when they came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they
assumed an inky colour, and pursued the rest of their way in slow
black rivulets. A humorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes
on her face, whereupon she threw up her hands, sank into a chair, and
went off into a deep vinousank attacksâ€”at intervals
she appeared suddenly at his side like an angry diamond, and hissed:
â€œYou promised!â€ into his ear.

The reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward men. The hall
was at present occupied by two deplorably sober men and their highly
indignant wives. The wives were sympathizing with each other in
slightly raised voices.

â€œWhenever he sees Iâ€™m having a good time he wants to go home.â€

â€œNever heard anything so selfish in my life.â€

â€œWeâ€™r
word to her, but the eagerness in his manner tightened abruptly into
formality as several people approached him to say goodbye.

Jordanâ€™s party were calling impatiently to her from the porch, but she
lingered for a moment to shake hands.

â€œIâ€™ve just heard the most amazing thing,â€ she whispered. â€œHow long
were we in there?â€

â€œWhy, about an hour.â€

â€œIt was â€¦ simply amazing,â€ she repeated abstractedly. â€œBut I swore I
wouldnâ€™t tell it and here I am tantalizing having known him in the garden.

â€œDonâ€™t mention it,â€ he enjoined me eagerly. â€œDonâ€™t give it another
thought, old sport.â€ The familiar expression held no more familiarity
than the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder. â€œAnd donâ€™t
forget weâ€™re going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning, at nine
oâ€™clock.â€

Then the butler, behind his shoulder:

â€œPhiladelphia wants you on the phone, sir.â€

â€œAll right, in a minute. Tell them Iâ€™ll be right there â€¦ Gooew coupÃ© which had
left Gatsbyâ€™s drive not two minutes before. The sharp jut of a wall
accounted for the detachment of the wheel, which was now getting
considerable attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs. However,
as they had left their cars blocking the road, a harsh, discordant din
from those in the rear had been audible for some time, and added to
the already violent confusion of the scene.

A man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in
the middle on into the wall?â€

â€œDonâ€™t ask me,â€ said Owl Eyes, washing his hands of the whole
matter. â€œI know very little about drivingâ€”next to nothing. It
happened, and thatâ€™s all I know.â€

â€œWell, if youâ€™re a poor driver you oughtnâ€™t to try driving at night.â€

â€œBut I wasnâ€™t even trying,â€ he explained indignantly, â€œI wasnâ€™t even
trying.â€

An awed hush fell upon the bystanders.

â€œDo you want to commit suicide?â€

â€œYouâ€™re lucky it was just a wheel! A baing tentatively
at the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe.

Blinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant
groaning of the horns, the apparition stood swaying for a moment
before he perceived the man in the duster.

â€œWhaâ€™s matter?â€ he inquired calmly. â€œDid we run outa gas?â€

â€œLook!â€

Half a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheelâ€”he stared at it
for a moment, and then looked upward as though he suspected that it
had dropped from the reverse.â€

â€œBut the wheelâ€™s off!â€

He hesitated.

â€œNo harm in trying,â€ he said.

The caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and I turned away and
cut across the lawn toward home. I glanced back once. A wafer of a
moon was shining over Gatsbyâ€™s house, making the night fine as before,
and surviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden.
A sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great
doors, endowing with complete isolation the forked. In the early morning the sun threw my
shadow westward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New York
to the Probity Trust. I knew the other clerks and young bond-salesmen
by their first names, and lunched with them in dark, crowded
restaurants on little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee. I
even had a short affair with a girl who lived in Jersey City and
worked in the accounting department, but her brother began throwing
mean looks in my direction, so when she went ohe Pennsylvania Station.

I began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night,
and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and
machines gives to the restless eye. I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue
and pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few
minutes I was going to enter into their lives, and no one would ever
know or disapprove. Sometimes, in my mind, I followed them to their
apartments on the corners of hidden streets, and they tr the theatre district, I
felt a sinking in my heart. Forms leaned together in the taxis as they
waited, and voices sang, and there was laughter from unheard jokes,
and lighted cigarettes made unintelligible circles inside. Imagining
that I, too, was hurrying towards gaiety and sharing their intimate
excitement, I wished them well.

For a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and then in midsummer I
found her again. At first I was flattered to go places with her,
because she was a golf chd the story about her that had eluded me
that night at Daisyâ€™s. At her first big golf tournament there was a
row that nearly reached the newspapersâ€”a suggestion that she had moved
her ball from a bad lie in the semifinal round. The thing approached
the proportions of a scandalâ€”then died away. A caddy retracted his
statement, and the only other witness admitted that he might have been
mistaken. The incident and the name had remained together in my mind.

Jordan Baker instinctively ain a woman is a thing you
never blame deeplyâ€”I was casually sorry, and then I forgot. It was on
that same house-party that we had a curious conversation about driving
a car. It started because she passed so close to some workmen that our
fender flicked a button on one manâ€™s coat.

â€œYouâ€™re a rotten driver,â€ I protested. â€œEither you ought to be more
careful, or you oughtnâ€™t to drive at all.â€

â€œI am careful.â€

â€œNo, youâ€™re not.â€

â€œWell, other people are,â€ srior rules that act as
brakes on my desires, and I knew that first I had to get myself
definitely out of that tangle back home. Iâ€™d been writing letters once
a week and signing them: â€œLove, Nick,â€ and all I could think of was
how, when that certain girl played tennis, a faint moustache of
perspiration appeared on her upper lip. Nevertheless there was a vague
understanding that had to be tactfully broken off before I was free.

Everyone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinecond cousin to the
devil. Reach me a rose, honey, and pour me a last drop into that there
crystal glass.â€

Once I wrote down on the empty spaces of a timetable the names of
those who came to Gatsbyâ€™s house that summer. It is an old timetable
now, disintegrating at its folds, and headed â€œThis schedule in effect
July 5th, 1922.â€ But I can still read the grey names, and they will
give you a better impression than my generalities of those who
accepted Gatsbyâ€™s hospitality and pais wife), and Edgar Beaver, whose hair, they say, turned
cotton-white one winter afternoon for no good reason at all.

Clarence Endive was from East Egg, as I remember. He came only once,
in white knickerbockers, and had a fight with a bum named Etty in the
garden. From farther out on the Island came the Cheadles and the O.
R. P. Schraeders, and the Stonewall Jackson Abrams of Georgia, and the
Fishguards and the Ripley Snells. Snell was there three days before he
went to the penitentiary, and Arthur McCarty, all connected with the
movies in one way or another. And the Catlips and the Bembergs and G.
Earl Muldoon, brother to that Muldoon who afterward strangled his
wife. Da Fontano the promoter came there, and Ed Legros and James B.
(â€œRot-Gutâ€) Ferret and the De Jongs and Ernest Lillyâ€”they came to
gamble, and when Ferret wandered into the garden it meant he was
cleaned out and Associated Traction would have to fluctuate profitably
next day.

A man named Klipspringeumping in front of a subway train in Times Square.

Benny McClenahan arrived always with four girls. They were never quite
the same ones in physical person, but they were so identical one with
another that it inevitably seemed they had been there before. I have
forgotten their namesâ€”Jaqueline, I think, or else Consuela, or Gloria
or Judy or June, and their last names were either the melodious names
of flowers and months or the sterner ones of the great American
capitalists whose cousint, I have forgotten.

All these people came to Gatsbyâ€™s house in the summer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

At nine oâ€™clock, one morning late in July, Gatsbyâ€™s gorgeous car
lurched up the rocky drive to my door and gave out a burst of melody
from its three-noted horn.

It was the first time he had called on me, though I had gone to two of
his parties, mounted in his hydroplane, and, at his urgent invitation,
made frequent use of his bte still; there was always a tapping
foot somewhere or the impatient opening and closing of a hand.

He saw me looking with admiration at his car.

â€œItâ€™s pretty, isnâ€™t it, old sport?â€ He jumped off to give me a better
view. â€œHavenâ€™t you ever seen it before?â€

Iâ€™d seen it. Everybody had seen it. It was a rich cream colour, bright
with nickel, swollen here and there in its monstrous length with
triumphant hatboxes and supper-boxes and toolboxes, and terraced with
a labyr We hadnâ€™t reached West Egg
village before Gatsby began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished
and slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his caramel-coloured
suit.

â€œLook here, old sport,â€ he broke out surprisingly, â€œwhatâ€™s your
opinion of me, anyhow?â€

A little overwhelmed, I began the generalized evasions which that
question deserves.

â€œWell, Iâ€™m going to tell you something about my life,â€ he interrupted.
â€œI donâ€™t want you to get a wrong idea of me frrdan Baker had believed he
was lying. He hurried the phrase â€œeducated at Oxford,â€ or swallowed
it, or choked on it, as though it had bothered him before. And with
this doubt, his whole statement fell to pieces, and I wondered if
there wasnâ€™t something a little sinister about him, after all.

â€œWhat part of the Middle West?â€ I inquired casually.

â€œSan Francisco.â€

â€œI see.â€

â€œMy family all died and I came into a good deal of money.â€

His voice was solemn, as if tr. The very
phrases were worn so threadbare that they evoked no image except that
of a turbaned â€œcharacterâ€ leaking sawdust at every pore as he pursued
a tiger through the Bois de Boulogne.

â€œThen came the war, old sport. It was a great relief, and I tried very
hard to die, but I seemed to bear an enchanted life. I accepted a
commission as first lieutenant when it began. In the Argonne Forest I
took the remains of my machine-gun battalion so far forward that there
was a half mile . The smile comprehended Montenegroâ€™s troubled history and
sympathized with the brave struggles of the Montenegrin people. It
appreciated fully the chain of national circumstances which had
elicited this tribute from Montenegroâ€™s warm little heart. My
incredulity was submerged in fascination now; it was like skimming
hastily through a dozen magazines.

He reached in his pocket, and a piece of metal, slung on a ribbon,
fell into my palm.

â€œThatâ€™s the one from Montenegro.â€

Ts. There was Gatsby,
looking a little, not much, youngerâ€”with a cricket bat in his hand.

Then it was all true. I saw the skins of tigers flaming in his palace
on the Grand Canal; I saw him opening a chest of rubies to ease, with
their crimson-lighted depths, the gnawings of his broken heart.

â€œIâ€™m going to make a big request of you today,â€ he said, pocketing his
souvenirs with satisfaction, â€œso I thought you ought to know something
about me. I didnâ€™t want you to think I was™t the faintest idea what â€œthis matterâ€ was, but I was more
annoyed than interested. I hadnâ€™t asked Jordan to tea in order to
discuss Mr. Jay Gatsby. I was sure the request would be something
utterly fantastic, and for a moment I was sorry Iâ€™d ever set foot upon
his overpopulated lawn.

He wouldnâ€™t say another word. His correctness grew on him as we neared
the city. We passed Port Roosevelt, where there was a glimpse of
red-belted oceangoing ships, and sped along a cobbled slum sport,â€ called Gatsby. We slowed down. Taking a white
card from his wallet, he waved it before the manâ€™s eyes.

â€œRight you are,â€ agreed the policeman, tipping his cap. â€œKnow you next
time, Mr. Gatsby. Excuse me!â€

â€œWhat was that?â€ I inquired. â€œThe picture of Oxford?â€

â€œI was able to do the commissioner a favour once, and he sends me a
Christmas card every year.â€

Over the great bridge, with the sunlight through the girders making a
constant flicker upon the mrt
upper lips of southeastern Europe, and I was glad that the sight of
Gatsbyâ€™s splendid car was included in their sombre holiday. As we
crossed Blackwellâ€™s Island a limousine passed us, driven by a white
chauffeur, in which sat three modish negroes, two bucks and a girl. I
laughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us in
haughty rivalry.

â€œAnything can happen now that weâ€™ve slid over this bridge,â€ I thought;
â€œanything at all â€¦â€

Even Gatsby could happer nostril. After a
moment I discovered his tiny eyes in the half-darkness.

â€œâ€”So I took one look at him,â€ said Mr. Wolfshiem, shaking my hand
earnestly, â€œand what do you think I did?â€

â€œWhat?â€ I inquired politely.

But evidently he was not addressing me, for he dropped my hand and
covered Gatsby with his expressive nose.

â€œI handed the money to Katspaugh and I said: â€˜All right, Katspaugh,
donâ€™t pay him a penny till he shuts his mouth.â€™ He shut it then and
thereHot and smallâ€”yes,â€ said Mr. Wolfshiem, â€œbut full of memories.â€

â€œWhat place is that?â€ I asked.

â€œThe old Metropole.â€

â€œThe old Metropole,â€ brooded Mr. Wolfshiem gloomily. â€œFilled with
faces dead and gone. Filled with friends gone now forever. I canâ€™t
forget so long as I live the night they shot Rosy Rosenthal there. It
was six of us at the table, and Rosy had eat and drunk a lot all
evening. When it was almost morning the waiter came up to him with a
funny lood around in the door and says: â€˜Donâ€™t let that waiter take away
my coffee!â€™ Then he went out on the sidewalk, and they shot him three
times in his full belly and drove away.â€

â€œFour of them were electrocuted,â€ I said, remembering.

â€œFive, with Becker.â€ His nostrils turned to me in an interested way.
â€œI understand youâ€™re looking for a business gonnegtion.â€

The juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling. Gatsby answered
for me:

â€œOh, no,â€ he exclaimed, e
directly behind. I think that, except for my presence, he would have
taken one short glance beneath our own table.

â€œLook here, old sport,â€ said Gatsby, leaning toward me, â€œIâ€™m afraid I
made you a little angry this morning in the car.â€

There was the smile again, but this time I held out against it.

â€œI donâ€™t like mysteries,â€ I answered, â€œand I donâ€™t understand why you
wonâ€™t come out frankly and tell me what you want. Why has it all got
to come through Miss Bakh!â€

â€œHe went to Oggsford College in England. You know Oggsford College?â€

â€œIâ€™ve heard of it.â€

â€œItâ€™s one of the most famous colleges in the world.â€

â€œHave you known Gatsby for a long time?â€ I inquired.

â€œSeveral years,â€ he answered in a gratified way. â€œI made the pleasure
of his acquaintance just after the war. But I knew I had discovered a
man of fine breeding after I talked with him an hour. I said to
myself: â€˜Thereâ€™s the kind of man youâ€™d like ta friendâ€™s
wife.â€

When the subject of this instinctive trust returned to the table and
sat down Mr. Wolfshiem drank his coffee with a jerk and got to his
feet.

â€œI have enjoyed my lunch,â€ he said, â€œand Iâ€™m going to run off from you
two young men before I outstay my welcome.â€

â€œDonâ€™t hurry Meyer,â€ said Gatsby, without enthusiasm. Mr. Wolfshiem
raised his hand in a sort of benediction.

â€œYouâ€™re very polite, but I belong to another generation,â€ he announced
rkâ€”a
denizen of Broadway.â€

â€œWho is he, anyhow, an actor?â€

â€œNo.â€

â€œA dentist?â€

â€œMeyer Wolfshiem? No, heâ€™s a gambler.â€ Gatsby hesitated, then added,
coolly: â€œHeâ€™s the man who fixed the Worldâ€™s Series back in 1919.â€

â€œFixed the Worldâ€™s Series?â€ I repeated.

The idea staggered me. I remembered, of course, that the Worldâ€™s
Series had been fixed in 1919, but if I had thought of it at all I
would have thought of it as a thing that merely happenedrowded room.

â€œCome along with me for a minute,â€ I said; â€œIâ€™ve got to say hello to
someone.â€

When he saw us Tom jumped up and took half a dozen steps in our
direction.

â€œWhereâ€™ve you been?â€ he demanded eagerly. â€œDaisyâ€™s furious because you
havenâ€™t called up.â€

â€œThis is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan.â€

They shook hands briefly, and a strained, unfamiliar look of
embarrassment came over Gatsbyâ€™s face.

â€œHowâ€™ve you been, anyhow?â€ demanded Tom of me. âns. I was happier on the lawns because I had on
shoes from England with rubber knobs on the soles that bit into the
soft ground. I had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the
wind, and whenever this happened the red, white, and blue banners in
front of all the houses stretched out stiff and said tut-tut-tut-tut,
in a disapproving way.

The largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged to
Daisy Fayâ€™s house. She was just eighteen, two years older than me, and

didnâ€™t see me until I was five feet away.

â€œHello, Jordan,â€ she called unexpectedly. â€œPlease come here.â€

I was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because of all the
older girls I admired her most. She asked me if I was going to the Red
Cross to make bandages. I was. Well, then, would I tell them that she
couldnâ€™t come that day? The officer looked at Daisy while she was
speaking, in a way that every young girl wants to be looked at
sometime, and because it seemed roer had
found her packing her bag one winter night to go to New York and say
goodbye to a soldier who was going overseas. She was effectually
prevented, but she wasnâ€™t on speaking terms with her family for
several weeks. After that she didnâ€™t play around with the soldiers any
more, but only with a few flat-footed, shortsighted young men in town,
who couldnâ€™t get into the army at all.

By the next autumn she was gay again, gay as ever. She had a dÃ©but
after the armistice, and in Feon her bed as lovely as the June
night in her flowered dressâ€”and as drunk as a monkey. She had a bottle
of Sauterne in one hand and a letter in the other.

â€œâ€Šâ€™Gratulate me,â€ she muttered. â€œNever had a drink before, but oh how
I do enjoy it.â€

â€œWhatâ€™s the matter, Daisy?â€

I was scared, I can tell you; Iâ€™d never seen a girl like that before.

â€œHere, dearies.â€ She groped around in a wastebasket she had with her
on the bed and pulled out the string of pearls. â€e snow.

But she didnâ€™t say another word. We gave her spirits of ammonia and
put ice on her forehead and hooked her back into her dress, and half
an hour later, when we walked out of the room, the pearls were around
her neck and the incident was over. Next day at five oâ€™clock she
married Tom Buchanan without so much as a shiver, and started off on a
three monthsâ€™ trip to the South Seas.

I saw them in Santa Barbara when they came back, and I thought Iâ€™d
never seen a girl so mado a wagon on the Ventura road one night,
and ripped a front wheel off his car. The girl who was with him got
into the papers, too, because her arm was brokenâ€”she was one of the
chambermaids in the Santa Barbara Hotel.

The next April Daisy had her little girl, and they went to France for
a year. I saw them one spring in Cannes, and later in Deauville, and
then they came back to Chicago to settle down. Daisy was popular in
Chicago, as you know. They moved with a fast crowd, all of them by for the first
time in years. It was when I asked youâ€”do you remember?â€”if you knew
Gatsby in West Egg. After you had gone home she came into my room and
woke me up, and said: â€œWhat Gatsby?â€ and when I described himâ€”I was
half asleepâ€”she said in the strangest voice that it must be the man
she used to know. It wasnâ€™t until then that I connected this Gatsby
with the officer in her white car.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

When Jo said.

â€œBut it wasnâ€™t a coincidence at all.â€

â€œWhy not?â€

â€œGatsby bought that house so that Daisy would be just across the bay.â€

Then it had not been merely the stars to which he had aspired on that
June night. He came alive to me, delivered suddenly from the womb of
his purposeless splendour.

â€œHe wants to know,â€ continued Jordan, â€œif youâ€™ll invite Daisy to your
house some afternoon and then let him come over.â€

The modesty of the demand shook me. He hadained. â€œAnd your house is
right next door.â€

â€œOh!â€

â€œI think he half expected her to wander into one of his parties, some
night,â€ went on Jordan, â€œbut she never did. Then he began asking
people casually if they knew her, and I was the first one he found. It
was that night he sent for me at his dance, and you should have heard
the elaborate way he worked up to it. Of course, I immediately
suggested a luncheon in New Yorkâ€”and I thought heâ€™d go mad:

â€œâ€Šâ€˜I donâ€™t dinner. Suddenly I wasnâ€™t thinking of Daisy and Gatsby any more,
but of this clean, hard, limited person, who dealt in universal
scepticism, and who leaned back jauntily just within the circle of my
arm. A phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort of heady
excitement: â€œThere are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy, and
the tired.â€

â€œAnd Daisy ought to have something in her life,â€ murmured Jordan to
me.

â€œDoes she want to see Gatsby?â€

â€œSheâ€™s not to know aboue.


                                  V

When I came home to West Egg that night I was afraid for a moment that
my house was on fire. Two oâ€™clock and the whole corner of the
peninsula was blazing with light, which fell unreal on the shrubbery
and made thin elongating glints upon the roadside wires. Turning a
corner, I saw that it was Gatsbyâ€™s house, lit from tower to cellar.

At first I thought it was another party, a wild rout that had resolved
itself into â€œhide-and-go-seekâ€d, old
sport. In my car.â€

â€œItâ€™s too late.â€

â€œWell, suppose we take a plunge in the swimming pool? I havenâ€™t made
use of it all summer.â€

â€œIâ€™ve got to go to bed.â€

â€œAll right.â€

He waited, looking at me with suppressed eagerness.

â€œI talked with Miss Baker,â€ I said after a moment. â€œIâ€™m going to call
up Daisy tomorrow and invite her over here to tea.â€

â€œOh, thatâ€™s all right,â€ he said carelessly. â€œI donâ€™t want to put you
to any trouble.e thing,â€ he said uncertainly, and hesitated.

â€œWould you rather put it off for a few days?â€ I asked.

â€œOh, it isnâ€™t about that. At leastâ€”â€ He fumbled with a series of
beginnings. â€œWhy, I thoughtâ€”why, look here, old sport, you donâ€™t make
much money, do you?â€

â€œNot very much.â€

This seemed to reassure him and he continued more confidently.

â€œI thought you didnâ€™t, if youâ€™ll pardon myâ€”you see, I carry on a
little business on the side, a sort of side liservice to be rendered, I had no
choice except to cut him off there.

â€œIâ€™ve got my hands full,â€ I said. â€œIâ€™m much obliged but I couldnâ€™t
take on any more work.â€

â€œYou wouldnâ€™t have to do any business with Wolfshiem.â€ Evidently he
thought that I was shying away from the â€œgonnegtionâ€ mentioned at
lunch, but I assured him he was wrong. He waited a moment longer,
hoping Iâ€™d begin a conversation, but I was too absorbed to be
responsive, so he went unwillingly home.n was pouring rain. At eleven oâ€™clock a man in a
raincoat, dragging a lawn-mower, tapped at my front door and said that
Mr. Gatsby had sent him over to cut my grass. This reminded me that I
had forgotten to tell my Finn to come back, so I drove into West Egg
Village to search for her among soggy whitewashed alleys and to buy
some cups and lemons and flowers.

The flowers were unnecessary, for at two oâ€™clock a greenhouse arrived
from Gatsbyâ€™s, with innumerable receptacles to containing.

â€œLooks very good,â€ he remarked vaguely. â€œOne of the papers said they
thought the rain would stop about four. I think it was The
Journal. Have you got everything you need in the shape ofâ€”of tea?â€

I took him into the pantry, where he looked a little reproachfully at
the Finn. Together we scrutinized the twelve lemon cakes from the
delicatessen shop.

â€œWill they do?â€ I asked.

â€œOf course, of course! Theyâ€™re fine!â€ and he added hollowly, â€œâ€¦ old
sport.â€
 coming to tea. Itâ€™s too late!â€ He looked at his watch as if
there was some pressing demand on his time elsewhere. â€œI canâ€™t wait
all day.â€

â€œDonâ€™t be silly; itâ€™s just two minutes to four.â€

He sat down miserably, as if I had pushed him, and simultaneously
there was the sound of a motor turning into my lane. We both jumped
up, and, a little harrowed myself, I went out into the yard.

Under the dripping bare lilac-trees a large open car was coming up the
drive. It stopp her from the car.

â€œAre you in love with me,â€ she said low in my ear, â€œor why did I have
to come alone?â€

â€œThatâ€™s the secret of Castle Rackrent. Tell your chauffeur to go far
away and spend an hour.â€

â€œCome back in an hour, Ferdie.â€ Then in a grave murmur: â€œHis name is
Ferdie.â€

â€œDoes the gasoline affect his nose?â€

â€œI donâ€™t think so,â€ she said innocently. â€œWhy?â€

We went in. To my overwhelming surprise the living-room was deserted.

â€œWellare of the loud beating of my
own heart I pulled the door to against the increasing rain.

For half a minute there wasnâ€™t a sound. Then from the living-room I
heard a sort of choking murmur and part of a laugh, followed by
Daisyâ€™s voice on a clear artificial note:

â€œI certainly am awfully glad to see you again.â€

A pause; it endured horribly. I had nothing to do in the hall, so I
went into the room.

Gatsby, his hands still in his pockets, was reclining against the
mantelpieressure of his
head, whereupon he turned and caught it with trembling fingers, and
set it back in place. Then he sat down, rigidly, his elbow on the arm
of the sofa and his chin in his hand.

â€œIâ€™m sorry about the clock,â€ he said.

My own face had now assumed a deep tropical burn. I couldnâ€™t muster up
a single commonplace out of the thousand in my head.

â€œItâ€™s an old clock,â€ I told them idiotically.

I think we all believed for a moment that it had smashed in pieces on
self into a shadow and,
while Daisy and I talked, looked conscientiously from one to the other
of us with tense, unhappy eyes. However, as calmness wasnâ€™t an end in
itself, I made an excuse at the first possible moment, and got to my
feet.

â€œWhere are you going?â€ demanded Gatsby in immediate alarm.

â€œIâ€™ll be back.â€

â€œIâ€™ve got to speak to you about something before you go.â€

He followed me wildly into the kitchen, closed the door, and
whispered: â€œOh, God!â€ in a isyâ€™s sitting in there all alone.â€

He raised his hand to stop my words, looked at me with unforgettable
reproach, and, opening the door cautiously, went back into the other
room.

I walked out the back wayâ€”just as Gatsby had when he had made his
nervous circuit of the house half an hour beforeâ€”and ran for a huge
black knotted tree, whose massed leaves made a fabric against the
rain. Once more it was pouring, and my irregular lawn, well-shaved by
Gatsbyâ€™s gardener, abounded i Familyâ€”he went into an immediate
decline. His children sold his house with the black wreath still on
the door. Americans, while willing, even eager, to be serfs, have
always been obstinate about being peasantry.

After half an hour, the sun shone again, and the grocerâ€™s automobile
rounded Gatsbyâ€™s drive with the raw material for his servantsâ€™
dinnerâ€”I felt sure he wouldnâ€™t eat a spoonful. A maid began opening
the upper windows of his house, appeared momentarily in each, and,ch, looking at each other as if
some question had been asked, or was in the air, and every vestige of
embarrassment was gone. Daisyâ€™s face was smeared with tears, and when
I came in she jumped up and began wiping at it with her handkerchief
before a mirror. But there was a change in Gatsby that was simply
confounding. He literally glowed; without a word or a gesture of
exultation a new well-being radiated from him and filled the little
room.

â€œOh, hello, old sport,â€ he said, as ifoy.

â€œI want you and Daisy to come over to my house,â€ he said, â€œIâ€™d like to
show her around.â€

â€œYouâ€™re sure you want me to come?â€

â€œAbsolutely, old sport.â€

Daisy went upstairs to wash her faceâ€”too late I thought with
humiliation of my towelsâ€”while Gatsby and I waited on the lawn.

â€œMy house looks well, doesnâ€™t it?â€ he demanded. â€œSee how the whole
front of it catches the light.â€

I agreed that it was splendid.

â€œYes.â€ His eyes went over it, â€ he corrected himself. â€œI was in the
drug business and then I was in the oil business. But Iâ€™m not in
either one now.â€ He looked at me with more attention. â€œDo you mean
youâ€™ve been thinking over what I proposed the other night?â€

Before I could answer, Daisy came out of the house and two rows of
brass buttons on her dress gleamed in the sunlight.

â€œThat huge place there?â€ she cried pointing.

â€œDo you like it?â€

â€œI love it, but I donâ€™t see how you live there. It was strange to reach the marble steps and find
no stir of bright dresses in and out the door, and hear no sound but
bird voices in the trees.

And inside, as we wandered through Marie Antoinette music-rooms and
Restoration Salons, I felt that there were guests concealed behind
every couch and table, under orders to be breathlessly silent until we
had passed through. As Gatsby closed the door of â€œthe Merton College
Libraryâ€ I could have sworn I heard the owl-eyed man break into
y, where we sat
down and drank a glass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard in
the wall.

He hadnâ€™t once ceased looking at Daisy, and I think he revalued
everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew
from her well-loved eyes. Sometimes too, he stared around at his
possessions in a dazed way, as though in her actual and astounding
presence none of it was any longer real. Once he nearly toppled down a
flight of stairs.

His bedroom was the simplest room of of the idea so long,
dreamed it right through to the end, waited with his teeth set, so to
speak, at an inconceivable pitch of intensity. Now, in the reaction,
he was running down like an over-wound clock.

Recovering himself in a minute he opened for us two hulking patent
cabinets which held his massed suits and dressing-gowns and ties, and
his shirts, piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high.

â€œIâ€™ve got a man in England who buys me clothes. He sends over a
selection of things atained sound, Daisy bent her head into
the shirts and began to cry stormily.

â€œTheyâ€™re such beautiful shirts,â€ she sobbed, her voice muffled in the
thick folds. â€œIt makes me sad because Iâ€™ve never seen suchâ€”such
beautiful shirts before.â€

------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the house, we were to see the grounds and the swimming pool, and
the hydroplane, and the midsummer flowersâ€”but outside Gatsbyâ€™s window
it began to rain a from Daisy it had seemed very
near to her, almost touching her. It had seemed as close as a star to
the moon. Now it was again a green light on a dock. His count of
enchanted objects had diminished by one.

I began to walk about the room, examining various indefinite objects
in the half darkness. A large photograph of an elderly man in yachting
costume attracted me, hung on the wall over his desk.

â€œWhoâ€™s this?â€

â€œThat? Thatâ€™s Mr. Dan Cody, old sport.â€

The name soundedit. I was going to ask to see the
rubies when the phone rang, and Gatsby took up the receiver.

â€œYes â€¦ Well, I canâ€™t talk now â€¦ I canâ€™t talk now, old sport â€¦ I said a
small town â€¦ He must know what a small town is â€¦ Well, heâ€™s no use to
us if Detroit is his idea of a small town â€¦â€

He rang off.

â€œCome here quick!â€ cried Daisy at the window.

The rain was still falling, but the darkness had parted in the west,
and there was a pink and golden billow of foamy c, slightly worn young man, with
shell-rimmed glasses and scanty blond hair. He was now decently
clothed in a â€œsport shirt,â€ open at the neck, sneakers, and duck
trousers of a nebulous hue.

â€œDid we interrupt your exercise?â€ inquired Daisy politely.

â€œI was asleep,â€ cried Mr. Klipspringer, in a spasm of embarrassment.
â€œThat is, Iâ€™d been asleep. Then I got up â€¦â€

â€œKlipspringer plays the piano,â€ said Gatsby, cutting him off. â€œDonâ€™t
you, Ewing, old sport?â€
ger had played â€œThe Love Nestâ€ he turned around on the
bench and searched unhappily for Gatsby in the gloom.

â€œIâ€™m all out of practice, you see. I told you I couldnâ€™t play. Iâ€™m all
out of pracâ€”â€

â€œDonâ€™t talk so much, old sport,â€ commanded Gatsby. â€œPlay!â€

 â€œIn the morning, In the evening, Ainâ€™t we got funâ€”â€

Outside the wind was loud and there was a faint flow of thunder along
the Sound. All the lights were going on in West Egg now; the electric
traist
five years! There must have been moments even that afternoon when
Daisy tumbled short of his dreamsâ€”not through her own fault, but
because of the colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyond
her, beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with a creative
passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright
feather that drifted his way. No amount of fire or freshness can
challenge what a man can store up in his ghostly heart.

As I watched him he adjusI went
out of the room and down the marble steps into the rain, leaving them
there together.


                                  VI

About this time an ambitious young reporter from New York arrived one
morning at Gatsbyâ€™s door and asked him if he had anything to say.

â€œAnything to say about what?â€ inquired Gatsby politely.

â€œWhyâ€”any statement to give out.â€

It transpired after a confused five minutes that the man had heard
Gatsbyâ€™s name around his office in a connecmselves to
him, and there was one persistent story that he didnâ€™t live in a house
at all, but in a boat that looked like a house and was moved secretly
up and down the Long Island shore. Just why these inventions were a
source of satisfaction to James Gatz of North Dakota, isnâ€™t easy to
say.

James Gatzâ€”that was really, or at least legally, his name. He had
changed it at the age of seventeen and at the specific moment that
witnessed the beginning of his careerâ€”when he saw Dan Coon
had never really accepted them as his parents at all. The truth was
that Jay Gatsby of West Egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonic
conception of himself. He was a son of Godâ€”a phrase which, if it means
anything, means just thatâ€”and he must be about His Fatherâ€™s business,
the service of a vast, vulgar, and meretricious beauty. So he invented
just the sort of Jay Gatsby that a seventeen-year-old boy would be
likely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end.
absorption he took for granted.

But his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot. The most grotesque
and fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night. A universe of
ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the clock
ticked on the washstand and the moon soaked with wet light his tangled
clothes upon the floor. Each night he added to the pattern of his
fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an
oblivious embrace. For a while these reveries providy through. Then he drifted back to
Lake Superior, and he was still searching for something to do on the
day that Dan Codyâ€™s yacht dropped anchor in the shallows alongshore.

Cody was fifty years old then, a product of the Nevada silver fields,
of the Yukon, of every rush for metal since seventy-five. The
transactions in Montana copper that made him many times a millionaire
found him physically robust but on the verge of soft-mindedness, and,
suspecting this, an infinite number of womenlamour in the world. I
suppose he smiled at Codyâ€”he had probably discovered that people liked
him when he smiled. At any rate Cody asked him a few questions (one of
them elicited the brand new name) and found that he was quick and
extravagantly ambitious. A few days later he took him to Duluth and
bought him a blue coat, six pairs of white duck trousers, and a
yachting cap. And when the Tuolomee left for the West Indies and the
Barbary Coast, Gatsby left too.

He was employed in a vagr Dan Cody
inhospitably died.

I remember the portrait of him up in Gatsbyâ€™s bedroom, a grey, florid
man with a hard, empty faceâ€”the pioneer debauchee, who during one
phase of American life brought back to the Eastern seaboard the savage
violence of the frontier brothel and saloon. It was indirectly due to
Cody that Gatsby drank so little. Sometimes in the course of gay
parties women used to rub champagne into his hair; for himself he
formed the habit of letting liquor alone.

Andit down here with
the idea of exploding those first wild rumours about his antecedents,
which werenâ€™t even faintly true. Moreover he told it to me at a time
of confusion, when I had reached the point of believing everything and
nothing about him. So I take advantage of this short halt, while
Gatsby, so to speak, caught his breath, to clear this set of
misconceptions away.

It was a halt, too, in my association with his affairs. For several
weeks I didnâ€™t see him or hear his voice onere previously.

â€œIâ€™m delighted to see you,â€ said Gatsby, standing on his porch. â€œIâ€™m
delighted that you dropped in.â€

As though they cared!

â€œSit right down. Have a cigarette or a cigar.â€ He walked around the
room quickly, ringing bells. â€œIâ€™ll have something to drink for you in
just a minute.â€

He was profoundly affected by the fact that Tom was there. But he
would be uneasy anyhow until he had given them something, realizing in
a vague way that that was all t.
â€œSo we did. I remember very well.â€

â€œAbout two weeks ago.â€

â€œThatâ€™s right. You were with Nick here.â€

â€œI know your wife,â€ continued Gatsby, almost aggressively.

â€œThat so?â€

Tom turned to me.

â€œYou live near here, Nick?â€

â€œNext door.â€

â€œThat so?â€

Mr. Sloane didnâ€™t enter into the conversation, but lounged back
haughtily in his chair; the woman said nothing eitherâ€”until
unexpectedly, after two highballs, she became cordial.

â€œWeâ€™l
â€œYou come to supper with me,â€ said the lady enthusiastically. â€œBoth of
you.â€

This included me. Mr. Sloane got to his feet.

â€œCome along,â€ he saidâ€”but to her only.

â€œI mean it,â€ she insisted. â€œIâ€™d love to have you. Lots of room.â€

Gatsby looked at me questioningly. He wanted to go and he didnâ€™t see
that Mr. Sloane had determined he shouldnâ€™t.

â€œIâ€™m afraid I wonâ€™t be able to,â€ I said.

â€œWell, you come,â€ she urged, concentrating on Gatsby.

ant him?â€

â€œShe says she does want him.â€

â€œShe has a big dinner party and he wonâ€™t know a soul there.â€ He
frowned. â€œI wonder where in the devil he met Daisy. By God, I may be
old-fashioned in my ideas, but women run around too much these days to
suit me. They meet all kinds of crazy fish.â€

Suddenly Mr. Sloane and the lady walked down the steps and mounted
their horses.

â€œCome on,â€ said Mr. Sloane to Tom, â€œweâ€™re late. Weâ€™ve got to go.â€  And
then to me: â€t in my memory from Gatsbyâ€™s other parties
that summer. There were the same people, or at least the same sort of
people, the same profusion of champagne, the same many-coloured,
many-keyed commotion, but I felt an unpleasantness in the air, a
pervading harshness that hadnâ€™t been there before. Or perhaps I had
merely grown used to it, grown to accept West Egg as a world complete
in itself, with its own standards and its own great figures, second to
nothing because it had no consciousneange it for you. Just mention my name. Or present a green card.
Iâ€™m giving out greenâ€”â€

â€œLook around,â€ suggested Gatsby.

â€œIâ€™m looking around. Iâ€™m having a marvellousâ€”â€

â€œYou must see the faces of many people youâ€™ve heard about.â€

Tomâ€™s arrogant eyes roamed the crowd.

â€œWe donâ€™t go around very much,â€ he said; â€œin fact, I was just thinking
I donâ€™t know a soul here.â€

â€œPerhaps you know that lady.â€ Gatsby indicated a gorgeous, scarcely
humae.â€

But evidently the sound of it pleased Gatsby for Tom remained â€œthe
polo playerâ€ for the rest of the evening.

â€œIâ€™ve never met so many celebrities,â€ Daisy exclaimed. â€œI liked that
manâ€”what was his name?â€”with the sort of blue nose.â€

Gatsby identified him, adding that he was a small producer.

â€œWell, I liked him anyhow.â€

â€œIâ€™d a little rather not be the polo player,â€ said Tom pleasantly,
â€œIâ€™d rather look at all these famous people inâ€”in oblivio â€œA fellowâ€™s getting off some funny stuff.â€

â€œGo ahead,â€ answered Daisy genially, â€œand if you want to take down any
addresses hereâ€™s my little gold pencil.â€ â€¦ She looked around after a
moment and told me the girl was â€œcommon but pretty,â€ and I knew that
except for the half-hour sheâ€™d been alone with Gatsby she wasnâ€™t
having a good time.

We were at a particularly tipsy table. That was my faultâ€”Gatsby had
been called to the phone, and Iâ€™d enjoyed these same 
always starts screaming like that. I tell her she ought to leave it
alone.â€

â€œI do leave it alone,â€ affirmed the accused hollowly.

â€œWe heard you yelling, so I said to Doc Civet here: â€˜Thereâ€™s somebody
that needs your help, Doc.â€™â€Šâ€

â€œSheâ€™s much obliged, Iâ€™m sure,â€ said another friend, without
gratitude, â€œbut you got her dress all wet when you stuck her head in
the pool.â€

â€œAnything I hate is to get my head stuck in a pool,â€ mumbled Miss
Baedeker. ât occurred to me that he
had been very slowly bending toward her all evening to attain this
proximity, and even while I watched I saw him stoop one ultimate
degree and kiss at her cheek.

â€œI like her,â€ said Daisy, â€œI think sheâ€™s lovely.â€

But the rest offended herâ€”and inarguably because it wasnâ€™t a gesture
but an emotion. She was appalled by West Egg, this unprecedented
â€œplaceâ€ that Broadway had begotten upon a Long Island fishing
villageâ€”appalled by its raw vigour n indefinite procession of shadows, who rouged and powdered in an
invisible glass.

â€œWho is this Gatsby anyhow?â€ demanded Tom suddenly. â€œSome big
bootlegger?â€

â€œWhereâ€™d you hear that?â€ I inquired.

â€œI didnâ€™t hear it. I imagined it. A lot of these newly rich people are
just big bootleggers, you know.â€

â€œNot Gatsby,â€ I said shortly.

He was silent for a moment. The pebbles of the drive crunched under
his feet.

â€œWell, he certainly must have strained himselad never had before and
would never have again. When the melody rose her voice broke up
sweetly, following it, in a way contralto voices have, and each change
tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air.

â€œLots of people come who havenâ€™t been invited,â€ she said
suddenly. â€œThat girl hadnâ€™t been invited. They simply force their way
in and heâ€™s too polite to object.â€

â€œIâ€™d like to know who he is and what he does,â€ insisted Tom. â€œAnd I
think Iâ€™ll make ac possibilities totally absent from
her world. What was it up there in the song that seemed to be calling
her back inside? What would happen now in the dim, incalculable hours?
Perhaps some unbelievable guest would arrive, a person infinitely rare
and to be marvelled at, some authentically radiant young girl who with
one fresh glance at Gatsby, one moment of magical encounter, would
blot out those five years of unwavering devotion.

I stayed late that night. Gatsby asked me to wait untilsilent, and I guessed at his unutterable depression.

â€œI feel far away from her,â€ he said. â€œItâ€™s hard to make her
understand.â€

â€œYou mean about the dance?â€

â€œThe dance?â€ He dismissed all the dances he had given with a snap of
his fingers. â€œOld sport, the dance is unimportant.â€

He wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she should go to Tom and
say: â€œI never loved you.â€ After she had obliterated four years with
that sentence they could decide upon the more pr€

â€œCanâ€™t repeat the past?â€ he cried incredulously. â€œWhy of course you
can!â€

He looked around him wildly, as if the past were lurking here in the
shadow of his house, just out of reach of his hand.

â€œIâ€™m going to fix everything just the way it was before,â€ he said,
nodding determinedly. â€œSheâ€™ll see.â€

He talked a lot about the past, and I gathered that he wanted to
recover something, some idea of himself perhaps, that had gone into
loving Daisy. His life had at the two changes
of the year. The quiet lights in the houses were humming out into the
darkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars. Out of the
corner of his eye Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalks really
formed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the treesâ€”he could
climb to it, if he climbed alone, and once there he could suck on the
pap of life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder.

His heart beat faster as Daisyâ€™s white face came up to his own.t of lost words,
that I had heard somewhere a long time ago. For a moment a phrase
tried to take shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb manâ€™s,
as though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled
air. But they made no sound, and what I had almost remembered was
uncommunicable forever.


                                 VII

It was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest that the lights
in his house failed to go on one Saturday nightâ€”and, as obscurather worried. Tell him Mr.
Carraway came over.â€

â€œWho?â€ he demanded rudely.

â€œCarraway.â€

â€œCarraway. All right, Iâ€™ll tell him.â€

Abruptly he slammed the door.

My Finn informed me that Gatsby had dismissed every servant in his
house a week ago and replaced them with half a dozen others, who never
went into West Egg village to be bribed by the tradesmen, but ordered
moderate supplies over the telephone. The grocery boy reported that
the kitchen looked like a pigstyeyâ€™re all
brothers and sisters. They used to run a small hotel.â€

â€œI see.â€

He was calling up at Daisyâ€™s requestâ€”would I come to lunch at her
house tomorrow? Miss Baker would be there. Half an hour later Daisy
herself telephoned and seemed relieved to find that I was
coming. Something was up. And yet I couldnâ€™t believe that they would
choose this occasion for a sceneâ€”especially for the rather harrowing
scene that Gatsby had outlined in the garden.

The next day was br

â€œOh, my!â€ she gasped.

I picked it up with a weary bend and handed it back to her, holding it
at armâ€™s length and by the extreme tip of the corners to indicate that
I had no designs upon itâ€”but everyone near by, including the woman,
suspected me just the same.

â€œHot!â€ said the conductor to familiar faces. â€œSome weather! â€¦ Hot! â€¦
Hot! â€¦ Hot! â€¦ Is it hot enough for you? Is it hot? Is it â€¦â€Š?â€

My commutation ticket came back to me with a dark stain from his  Iâ€™ll see.â€

He set down the receiver and came toward us, glistening slightly, to
take our stiff straw hats.

â€œMadame expects you in the salon!â€ he cried, needlessly indicating the
direction. In this heat every extra gesture was an affront to the
common store of life.

The room, shadowed well with awnings, was dark and cool. Daisy and
Jordan lay upon an enormous couch, like silver idols weighing down
their own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans.

â€œWe canâ Jordan, â€œthat thatâ€™s Tomâ€™s girl on the
telephone.â€

We were silent. The voice in the hall rose high with annoyance: â€œVery
well, then, I wonâ€™t sell you the car at all â€¦ Iâ€™m under no obligations
to you at all â€¦ and as for your bothering me about it at lunch time, I
wonâ€™t stand that at all!â€

â€œHolding down the receiver,â€ said Daisy cynically.

â€œNo, heâ€™s not,â€ I assured her. â€œItâ€™s a bona-fide deal. I happen to
know about it.â€

Tom flung open the dound doubtfully.

â€œYou kiss Nick too.â€

â€œWhat a low, vulgar girl!â€

â€œI donâ€™t care!â€ cried Daisy, and began to clog on the brick fireplace.
Then she remembered the heat and sat down guiltily on the couch just
as a freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the room.

â€œBles-sed pre-cious,â€ she crooned, holding out her arms. â€œCome to your
own mother that loves you.â€

The child, relinquished by the nurse, rushed across the room and
rooted shyly into hee single wrinkle of the small white neck. â€œYou dream, you. You
absolute little dream.â€

â€œYes,â€ admitted the child calmly. â€œAunt Jordanâ€™s got on a white dress
too.â€

â€œHow do you like motherâ€™s friends?â€ Daisy turned her around so that
she faced Gatsby. â€œDo you think theyâ€™re pretty?â€

â€œWhereâ€™s Daddy?â€

â€œShe doesnâ€™t look like her father,â€ explained Daisy. â€œShe looks like
me. Sheâ€™s got my hair and shape of the face.â€

Daisy sat back upon the cry year,â€ said Tom
genially. â€œIt seems that pretty soon the earthâ€™s going to fall into
the sunâ€”or wait a minuteâ€”itâ€™s just the oppositeâ€”the sunâ€™s getting
colder every year.

â€œCome outside,â€ he suggested to Gatsby, â€œIâ€™d like you to have a look
at the place.â€

I went with them out to the veranda. On the green Sound, stagnant in
the heat, one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea.
Gatsbyâ€™s eyes followed it momentarily; he raised his hand and pointed
 the heat, and
drank down nervous gaiety with the cold ale.

â€œWhatâ€™ll we do with ourselves this afternoon?â€ cried Daisy, â€œand the
day after that, and the next thirty years?â€

â€œDonâ€™t be morbid,â€ Jordan said. â€œLife starts all over again when it
gets crisp in the fall.â€

â€œBut itâ€™s so hot,â€ insisted Daisy, on the verge of tears, â€œand
everythingâ€™s so confused. Letâ€™s all go to town!â€

Her voice struggled on through the heat, beating against it, moulding
i
She had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan saw. He was
astounded. His mouth opened a little, and he looked at Gatsby, and
then back at Daisy as if he had just recognized her as someone he knew
a long time ago.

â€œYou resemble the advertisement of the man,â€ she went on innocently.
â€œYou know the advertisement of the manâ€”â€

â€œAll right,â€ broke in Tom quickly, â€œIâ€™m perfectly willing to go to
town. Come onâ€”weâ€™re all going to town.â€

He got up, his eyes stsmoked all through lunch.â€

â€œOh, letâ€™s have fun,â€ she begged him. â€œItâ€™s too hot to fuss.â€

He didnâ€™t answer.

â€œHave it your own way,â€ she said. â€œCome on, Jordan.â€

They went upstairs to get ready while we three men stood there
shuffling the hot pebbles with our feet. A silver curve of the moon
hovered already in the western sky. Gatsby started to speak, changed
his mind, but not before Tom wheeled and faced him expectantly.

â€œHave you got your stables here? I remarked. â€œItâ€™s full ofâ€”â€ I
hesitated.

â€œHer voice is full of money,â€ he said suddenly.

That was it. Iâ€™d never understood before. It was full of moneyâ€”that
was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of
it, the cymbalsâ€™ song of it â€¦ High in a white palace the kingâ€™s
daughter, the golden girl â€¦

Tom came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel, followed
by Daisy and Jordan wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth and
carrt I can stop at a drugstore. You can buy anything at a
drugstore nowadays.â€

A pause followed this apparently pointless remark. Daisy looked at Tom
frowning, and an indefinable expression, at once definitely unfamiliar
and vaguely recognizable, as if I had only heard it described in
words, passed over Gatsbyâ€™s face.

â€œCome on, Daisy,â€ said Tom, pressing her with his hand toward Gatsbyâ€™s
car. â€œIâ€™ll take you in this circus wagon.â€

He opened the door, but she moved out f think Iâ€™m pretty dumb, donâ€™t you?â€ he suggested. â€œPerhaps I am,
but I have aâ€”almost a second sight, sometimes, that tells me what to
do. Maybe you donâ€™t believe that, but scienceâ€”â€

He paused. The immediate contingency overtook him, pulled him back
from the edge of theoretical abyss.

â€œIâ€™ve made a small investigation of this fellow,â€ he continued. â€œI
could have gone deeper if Iâ€™d knownâ€”â€

â€œDo you mean youâ€™ve been to a medium?â€ inquired Jordan humorosten, Tom. If youâ€™re such a snob, why did you invite him to lunch?â€
demanded Jordan crossly.

â€œDaisy invited him; she knew him before we were marriedâ€”God knows
where!â€

We were all irritable now with the fading ale, and aware of it we
drove for a while in silence. Then as Doctor T. J. Eckleburgâ€™s faded
eyes came into sight down the road, I remembered Gatsbyâ€™s caution
about gasoline.

â€œWeâ€™ve got enough to get us to town,â€ said Tom.

â€œBut thereâ€™s a garage rightthe matter?â€

â€œIâ€™m all run down.â€

â€œWell, shall I help myself?â€ Tom demanded. â€œYou sounded well enough on
the phone.â€

With an effort Wilson left the shade and support of the doorway and,
breathing hard, unscrewed the cap of the tank. In the sunlight his
face was green.

â€œI didnâ€™t mean to interrupt your lunch,â€ he said. â€œBut I need money
pretty bad, and I was wondering what you were going to do with your
old car.â€

â€œHow do you like this one?â€ inquiredent
against the pump, shading his eyes. â€œAnd now sheâ€™s going whether she
wants to or not. Iâ€™m going to get her away.â€

The coupÃ© flashed by us with a flurry of dust and the flash of a
waving hand.

â€œWhat do I owe you?â€ demanded Tom harshly.

â€œI just got wised up to something funny the last two days,â€ remarked
Wilson. â€œThatâ€™s why I want to get away. Thatâ€™s why I been bothering
you about the car.â€

â€œWhat do I owe you?â€

â€œDollar twenty.â€

The relenten the sick and the well. Wilson was so sick that
he looked guilty, unforgivably guiltyâ€”as if he had just got some poor
girl with child.

â€œIâ€™ll let you have that car,â€ said Tom. â€œIâ€™ll send it over tomorrow
afternoon.â€

That locality was always vaguely disquieting, even in the broad glare
of afternoon, and now I turned my head as though I had been warned of
something behind. Over the ash-heaps the giant eyes of Doctor T. J.
Eckleburg kept their vigil, but I perceived, aftefaces, but on Myrtle
Wilsonâ€™s face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until I realized
that her eyes, wide with jealous terror, were fixed not on Tom, but on
Jordan Baker, whom she took to be his wife.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, and as we
drove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic. His wife and his
mistress, until an hour ago secure and inviolate, were slipping
precip all sorts of
funny fruits were going to fall into your hands.â€

The word â€œsensuousâ€ had the effect of further disquieting Tom, but
before he could invent a protest the coupÃ© came to a stop, and Daisy
signalled us to draw up alongside.

â€œWhere are we going?â€ she cried.

â€œHow about the movies?â€

â€œItâ€™s so hot,â€ she complained. â€œYou go. Weâ€™ll ride around and meet you
after.â€ With an effort her wit rose faintly. â€œWeâ€™ll meet you on some
corner. Iâ€™ll be th explicable step of engaging
the parlour of a suite in the Plaza Hotel.

The prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us into
that room eludes me, though I have a sharp physical memory that, in
the course of it, my underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around
my legs and intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back.
The notion originated with Daisyâ€™s suggestion that we hire five
bathrooms and take cold baths, and then assumed more tangible form as
â€œa placryone
laughed.

â€œOpen another window,â€ commanded Daisy, without turning around.

â€œThere arenâ€™t any more.â€

â€œWell, weâ€™d better telephone for an axeâ€”â€

â€œThe thing to do is to forget about the heat,â€ said Tom impatiently.
â€œYou make it ten times worse by crabbing about it.â€

He unrolled the bottle of whisky from the towel and put it on the
table.

â€œWhy not let her alone, old sport?â€ remarked Gatsby. â€œYouâ€™re the one
that wanted to come to town.â€

pick that up?â€

â€œNow see here, Tom,â€ said Daisy, turning around from the mirror, â€œif
youâ€™re going to make personal remarks I wonâ€™t stay here a minute.
Call up and order some ice for the mint julep.â€

As Tom took up the receiver the compressed heat exploded into sound
and we were listening to the portentous chords of Mendelssohnâ€™s
Wedding March from the ballroom below.

â€œImagine marrying anybody in this heat!â€ cried Jordan dismally.

â€œStillâ€”I was married in thent she added as if she might have sounded irreverent, â€œThere
wasnâ€™t any connection.â€

â€œI used to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis,â€ I remarked.

â€œThat was his cousin. I knew his whole family history before he
left. He gave me an aluminium putter that I use today.â€

The music had died down as the ceremony began and now a long cheer
floated in at the window, followed by intermittent cries of
â€œYeaâ€”eaâ€”ea!â€ and finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing began.

â€œWeâ€e had room
for him.â€

Jordan smiled.

â€œHe was probably bumming his way home. He told me he was president of
your class at Yale.â€

Tom and I looked at each other blankly.

â€œBiloxi?â€

â€œFirst place, we didnâ€™t have any presidentâ€”â€

Gatsbyâ€™s foot beat a short, restless tattoo and Tom eyed him suddenly.

â€œBy the way, Mr. Gatsby, I understand youâ€™re an Oxford man.â€

â€œNot exactly.â€

â€œOh, yes, I understand you went to Oxford.â€

â€œYesâ€”I went therefive months. Thatâ€™s why I
canâ€™t really call myself an Oxford man.â€

Tom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief. But we were all
looking at Gatsby.

â€œIt was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the
armistice,â€ he continued. â€œWe could go to any of the universities in
England or France.â€

I wanted to get up and slap him on the back. I had one of those
renewals of complete faith in him that Iâ€™d experienced before.

Daisy rose, smiling faintlyone to the
other. â€œYouâ€™re causing a row. Please have a little self-control.â€

â€œSelf-control!â€ repeated Tom incredulously. â€œI suppose the latest
thing is to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your
wife. Well, if thatâ€™s the idea you can count me out â€¦ Nowadays people
begin by sneering at family life and family institutions, and next
theyâ€™ll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between
black and white.â€

Flushed with his impassioned gibbâ€ began Gatsby. But Daisy
guessed at his intention.

â€œPlease donâ€™t!â€ she interrupted helplessly. â€œPlease letâ€™s all go
home. Why donâ€™t we all go home?â€

â€œThatâ€™s a good idea,â€ I got up. â€œCome on, Tom. Nobody wants a drink.â€

â€œI want to know what Mr. Gatsby has to tell me.â€

â€œYour wife doesnâ€™t love you,â€ said Gatsby. â€œSheâ€™s never loved you.
She loves me.â€

â€œYou must be crazy!â€ exclaimed Tom automatically.

Gatsby sprang to his feet, vividâ€™s voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal
note. â€œWhatâ€™s been going on? I want to hear all about it.â€

â€œI told you whatâ€™s been going on,â€ said Gatsby. â€œGoing on for five
yearsâ€”and you didnâ€™t know.â€

Tom turned to Daisy sharply.

â€œYouâ€™ve been seeing this fellow for five years?â€

â€œNot seeing,â€ said Gatsby. â€œNo, we couldnâ€™t meet. But both of us loved
each other all that time, old sport, and you didnâ€™t know. I used to
laugh sometimesâ€â€”but then she married me and she loves me now.â€

â€œNo,â€ said Gatsby, shaking his head.

â€œShe does, though. The trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish
ideas in her head and doesnâ€™t know what sheâ€™s doing.â€ He nodded
sagely. â€œAnd whatâ€™s more, I love Daisy too. Once in a while I go off
on a spree and make a fool of myself, but I always come back, and in
my heart I love her all the time.â€

â€œYouâ€™re revolting,â€ said Daisy. She turned to me, and her voice,
dropping an oc€

She hesitated. Her eyes fell on Jordan and me with a sort of appeal,
as though she realized at last what she was doingâ€”and as though she
had never, all along, intended doing anything at all. But it was done
now. It was too late.

â€œI never loved him,â€ she said, with perceptible reluctance.

â€œNot at Kapiolani?â€ demanded Tom suddenly.

â€œNo.â€

From the ballroom beneath, muffled and suffocating chords were
drifting up on hot waves of air.

â€œNot that day I carried yst.â€ She began to sob
helplessly. â€œI did love him onceâ€”but I loved you too.â€

Gatsbyâ€™s eyes opened and closed.

â€œYou loved me too?â€ he repeated.

â€œEven thatâ€™s a lie,â€ said Tom savagely. â€œShe didnâ€™t know you were
alive. Whyâ€”thereâ€™s things between Daisy and me that youâ€™ll never know,
things that neither of us can ever forget.â€

The words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby.

â€œI want to speak to Daisy alone,â€ he insisted. â€œSheâ€™s all excited
nond laughed. He could afford to
control himself now. â€œWhyâ€™s that?â€

â€œDaisyâ€™s leaving you.â€

â€œNonsense.â€

â€œI am, though,â€ she said with a visible effort.

â€œSheâ€™s not leaving me!â€ Tomâ€™s words suddenly leaned down over Gatsby.
â€œCertainly not for a common swindler whoâ€™d have to steal the ring he
put on her finger.â€

â€œI wonâ€™t stand this!â€ cried Daisy. â€œOh, please letâ€™s get out.â€

â€œWho are you, anyhow?â€ broke out Tom. â€œYouâ€™re one of t stunts. I picked him for a
bootlegger the first time I saw him, and I wasnâ€™t far wrong.â€

â€œWhat about it?â€ said Gatsby politely. â€œI guess your friend Walter
Chase wasnâ€™t too proud to come in on it.â€

â€œAnd you left him in the lurch, didnâ€™t you? You let him go to jail for
a month over in New Jersey. God! You ought to hear Walter on the
subject of you.â€

â€œHe came to us dead broke. He was very glad to pick up some money, old
sport.â€

â€œDonâ€™t you call me â€˜olun to balance an invisible but
absorbing object on the tip of her chin. Then I turned back to
Gatsbyâ€”and was startled at his expression. He lookedâ€”and this is said
in all contempt for the babbled slander of his gardenâ€”as if he had
â€œkilled a man.â€ For a moment the set of his face could be described in
just that fantastic way.

It passed, and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy, denying
everything, defending his name against accusations that had not been
made. But with every wor Tom. â€œIn Mr. Gatsbyâ€™s car.â€

She looked at Tom, alarmed now, but he insisted with magnanimous
scorn.

â€œGo on. He wonâ€™t annoy you. I think he realizes that his presumptuous
little flirtation is over.â€

They were gone, without a word, snapped out, made accidental,
isolated, like ghosts, even from our pity.

After a moment Tom got up and began wrapping the unopened bottle of
whisky in the towel.

â€œWant any of this stuff? Jordan? â€¦ Nick?â€

I didnâ€™t answer.

â€œmits, and we were content to let all their tragic arguments
fade with the city lights behind. Thirtyâ€”the promise of a decade of
loneliness, a thinning list of single men to know, a thinning
briefcase of enthusiasm, thinning hair. But there was Jordan beside
me, who, unlike Daisy, was too wise ever to carry well-forgotten
dreams from age to age. As we passed over the dark bridge her wan face
fell lazily against my coatâ€™s shoulder and the formidable stroke of
thirty died away with the r him to go
to bed, but Wilson refused, saying that heâ€™d miss a lot of business if
he did. While his neighbour was trying to persuade him a violent
racket broke out overhead.

â€œIâ€™ve got my wife locked in up there,â€ explained Wilson calmly.
â€œSheâ€™s going to stay there till the day after tomorrow, and then weâ€™re
going to move away.â€

Michaelis was astonished; they had been neighbours for four years, and
Wilson had never seemed faintly capable of such a statement.
Generally
times on certain days. Just as the latter was getting uneasy, some
workmen came past the door bound for his restaurant, and Michaelis
took the opportunity to get away, intending to come back later. But he
didnâ€™t. He supposed he forgot to, thatâ€™s all. When he came outside
again, a little after seven, he was reminded of the conversation
because he heard Mrs. Wilsonâ€™s voice, loud and scolding, downstairs in
the garage.

â€œBeat me!â€ he heard her cry. â€œThrow me down and beat me, yk, came to rest a hundred yards
beyond, and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson, her life
violently extinguished, knelt in the road and mingled her thick dark
blood with the dust.

Michaelis and this man reached her first, but when they had torn open
her shirtwaist, still damp with perspiration, they saw that her left
breast was swinging loose like a flap, and there was no need to listen
for the heart beneath. The mouth was wide open and ripped a little at
the corners, as thor made him automatically put on the brakes.

â€œWeâ€™ll take a look,â€ he said doubtfully, â€œjust a look.â€

I became aware now of a hollow, wailing sound which issued incessantly
from the garage, a sound which as we got out of the coupÃ© and walked
toward the door resolved itself into the words â€œOh, my God!â€ uttered
over and over in a gasping moan.

â€œThereâ€™s some bad trouble here,â€ said Tom excitedly.

He reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the
hough she suffered from a chill in the hot night, lay on
a worktable by the wall, and Tom, with his back to us, was bending
over it, motionless. Next to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking
down names with much sweat and correction in a little book. At first I
couldnâ€™t find the source of the high, groaning words that echoed
clamorously through the bare garageâ€”then I saw Wilson standing on the
raised threshold of his office, swaying back and forth and holding to
the doorposts with bressed a mumbled incoherent remark to
the policeman.

â€œM-a-vâ€”â€ the policeman was saying, â€œâ€”oâ€”â€

â€œNo, râ€”â€ corrected the man, â€œM-a-v-r-oâ€”â€

â€œListen to me!â€ muttered Tom fiercely.

â€œrâ€”â€ said the policeman, â€œoâ€”â€

â€œgâ€”â€

â€œgâ€”â€ He looked up as Tomâ€™s broad hand fell sharply on his shoulder.
â€œWhat you want, fella?â€

â€œWhat happened?â€”thatâ€™s what I want to know.â€

â€œAuto hit her. Insâ€™antly killed.â€

â€œInstantly killame of this place here?â€ demanded the officer.

â€œHasnâ€™t got any name.â€

A pale well-dressed negro stepped near.

â€œIt was a yellow car,â€ he said, â€œbig yellow car. New.â€

â€œSee the accident?â€ asked the policeman.

â€œNo, but the car passed me down the road, going fasterâ€™n forty. Going
fifty, sixty.â€

â€œCome here and letâ€™s have your name. Look out now. I want to get his
name.â€

Some words of this conversation must have reached Wilson, swaying in
the offies and then
would have collapsed to his knees had not Tom held him upright.

â€œListen,â€ said Tom, shaking him a little. â€œI just got here a minute
ago, from New York. I was bringing you that coupÃ© weâ€™ve been talking
about. That yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasnâ€™t mineâ€”do you
hear? I havenâ€™t seen it all afternoon.â€

Only the negro and I were near enough to hear what he said, but the
policeman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent
eyes.

y.

â€œNow, if youâ€™ll let me have that name again correctâ€”â€

Picking up Wilson like a doll, Tom carried him into the office, set
him down in a chair, and came back.

â€œIf somebodyâ€™ll come here and sit with him,â€ he snapped
authoritatively. He watched while the two men standing closest glanced
at each other and went unwillingly into the room. Then Tom shut the
door on them and came down the single step, his eyes avoiding the
table. As he passed close to me he whispered: â€œL â€œHe didnâ€™t even stop his car.â€

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Buchanansâ€™ house floated suddenly toward us through the dark
rustling trees. Tom stopped beside the porch and looked up at the
second floor, where two windows bloomed with light among the vines.

â€œDaisyâ€™s home,â€ he said. As we got out of the car he glanced at me and
frowned slightly.

â€œI ought to have dropped you in West Egg, Nick. Thereâ€™s nothing we can
doJordan put her hand on my arm.

â€œWonâ€™t you come in, Nick?â€

â€œNo, thanks.â€

I was feeling a little sick and I wanted to be alone. But Jordan
lingered for a moment more.

â€œItâ€™s only half-past nine,â€ she said.

Iâ€™d be damned if Iâ€™d go in; Iâ€™d had enough of all of them for one day,
and suddenly that included Jordan too. She must have seen something of
this in my expression, for she turned abruptly away and ran up the
porch steps into the house. I sat down for a feœJust standing here, old sport.â€

Somehow, that seemed a despicable occupation. For all I knew he was
going to rob the house in a moment; I wouldnâ€™t have been surprised to
see sinister faces, the faces of â€œWolfshiemâ€™s people,â€ behind him in
the dark shrubbery.

â€œDid you see any trouble on the road?â€ he asked after a minute.

â€œYes.â€

He hesitated.

â€œWas she killed?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œI thought so; I told Daisy I thought so. Itâ€™s better that the shock
shouldpen?â€

â€œWell, I tried to swing the wheelâ€”â€ He broke off, and suddenly I
guessed at the truth.

â€œWas Daisy driving?â€

â€œYes,â€ he said after a moment, â€œbut of course Iâ€™ll say I was. You see,
when we left New York she was very nervous and she thought it would
steady her to driveâ€”and this woman rushed out at us just as we were
passing a car coming the other way. It all happened in a minute, but
it seemed to me that she wanted to speak to us, thought we were
somebody € he said presently. â€œIâ€™m just going to
wait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness
this afternoon. Sheâ€™s locked herself into her room, and if he tries
any brutality sheâ€™s going to turn the light out and on again.â€

â€œHe wonâ€™t touch her,â€ I said. â€œHeâ€™s not thinking about her.â€

â€œI donâ€™t trust him, old sport.â€

â€œHow long are you going to wait?â€

â€œAll night, if necessary. Anyhow, till they all go to bed.â€

A new point of viwere open, and I saw that the room was empty. Crossing the porch where
we had dined that June night three months before, I came to a small
rectangle of light which I guessed was the pantry window. The blind
was drawn, but I found a rift at the sill.

Daisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table,
with a plate of cold fried chicken between them, and two bottles of
ale. He was talking intently across the table at her, and in his
earnestness his hand had fallen upon an€œIs it all quiet up there?â€ he asked anxiously.

â€œYes, itâ€™s all quiet.â€ I hesitated. â€œYouâ€™d better come home and get
some sleep.â€

He shook his head.

â€œI want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed. Good night, old sport.â€

He put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his
scrutiny of the house, as though my presence marred the sacredness of
the vigil. So I walked away and left him standing there in the
moonlightâ€”watching over nothing.


        table in the hall, heavy with dejection or sleep.

â€œNothing happened,â€ he said wanly. â€œI waited, and about four oâ€™clock
she came to the window and stood there for a minute and then turned
out the light.â€

His house had never seemed so enormous to me as it did that night when
we hunted through the great rooms for cigarettes. We pushed aside
curtains that were like pavilions, and felt over innumerable feet of
dark wall for electric light switchesâ€”once I tumbled with a sort ofity for a week, or up to Montreal.â€

He wouldnâ€™t consider it. He couldnâ€™t possibly leave Daisy until he
knew what she was going to do. He was clutching at some last hope and
I couldnâ€™t bear to shake him free.

It was this night that he told me the strange story of his youth with
Dan Codyâ€”told it to me because â€œJay Gatsbyâ€ had broken up like glass
against Tomâ€™s hard malice, and the long secret extravaganza was played
out. I think that he would have acknowledged anything nereâ€”it was as casual a thing to her
as his tent out at camp was to him. There was a ripe mystery about it,
a hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other
bedrooms, of gay and radiant activities taking place through its
corridors, and of romances that were not musty and laid away already
in lavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this yearâ€™s
shining motorcars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely
withered. It excited him, too, that many men had already lovey and
unscrupulouslyâ€”eventually he took Daisy one still October night, took
her because he had no real right to touch her hand.

He might have despised himself, for he had certainly taken her under
false pretences. I donâ€™t mean that he had traded on his phantom
millions, but he had deliberately given Daisy a sense of security; he
let her believe that he was a person from much the same strata as
herselfâ€”that he was fully able to take care of her. As a matter of
fact, he had no suchished into her
rich house, into her rich, full life, leaving Gatsbyâ€”nothing. He felt
married to her, that was all.

When they met again, two days later, it was Gatsby who was breathless,
who was, somehow, betrayed. Her porch was bright with the bought
luxury of star-shine; the wicker of the settee squeaked fashionably as
she turned toward him and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth. She
had caught a cold, and it made her voice huskier and more charming
than ever, and Gatsby was ovelot
because I knew different things from her â€¦ Well, there I was, way off
my ambitions, getting deeper in love every minute, and all of a sudden
I didnâ€™t care. What was the use of doing great things if I could have
a better time telling her what I was going to do?â€

On the last afternoon before he went abroad, he sat with Daisy in his
arms for a long, silent time. It was a cold fall day, with fire in the
room and her cheeks flushed. Now and then she moved and he changed his
arm a --

He did extraordinarily well in the war. He was a captain before he
went to the front, and following the Argonne battles he got his
majority and the command of the divisional machine-guns. After the
armistice he tried frantically to get home, but some complication or
misunderstanding sent him to Oxford instead. He was worried nowâ€”there
was a quality of nervous despair in Daisyâ€™s letters. She didnâ€™t see
why he couldnâ€™t come. She was feeling the pressure of the world
outside, ag dust. At the grey tea hour there were
always rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low, sweet fever,
while fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by the
sad horns around the floor.

Through this twilight universe Daisy began to move again with the
season; suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with
half a dozen men, and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and
chiffon of an evening-dress tangled among dying orchids on the floor
beside her bed.y while he was
still at Oxford.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

It was dawn now on Long Island and we went about opening the rest of
the windows downstairs, filling the house with grey-turning,
gold-turning light. The shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the dew
and ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves. There was a
slow, pleasant movement in the air, scarcely a wind, promising a cool,
lovely day.

â€œI donâ€™t think she ever loe came out with a curious remark.

â€œIn any case,â€ he said, â€œit was just personal.â€

What could you make of that, except to suspect some intensity in his
conception of the affair that couldnâ€™t be measured?

He came back from France when Tom and Daisy were still on their
wedding trip, and made a miserable but irresistible journey to
Louisville on the last of his army pay. He stayed there a week,
walking the streets where their footsteps had clicked together through
the Novemben a
folding-chair, and the station slid away and the backs of unfamiliar
buildings moved by. Then out into the spring fields, where a yellow
trolley raced them for a minute with people in it who might once have
seen the pale magic of her face along the casual street.

The track curved and now it was going away from the sun, which, as it
sank lower, seemed to spread itself in benediction over the vanishing
city where she had drawn her breath. He stretched out his hand
desperately as if teps.

â€œIâ€™m going to drain the pool today, Mr. Gatsby. Leavesâ€™ll start
falling pretty soon, and then thereâ€™s always trouble with the pipes.â€

â€œDonâ€™t do it today,â€ Gatsby answered. He turned to me apologetically.
â€œYou know, old sport, Iâ€™ve never used that pool all summer?â€

I looked at my watch and stood up.

â€œTwelve minutes to my train.â€

I didnâ€™t want to go to the city. I wasnâ€™t worth a decent stroke of
work, but it was more than thatâ€”I didnâ€™t want 
â€œTheyâ€™re a rotten crowd,â€ I shouted across the lawn. â€œYouâ€™re worth the
whole damn bunch put together.â€

Iâ€™ve always been glad I said that. It was the only compliment I ever
gave him, because I disapproved of him from beginning to end. First he
nodded politely, and then his face broke into that radiant and
understanding smile, as if weâ€™d been in ecstatic cahoots on that fact
all the time. His gorgeous pink rag of a suit made a bright spot of
colour against the white steps----------------

Up in the city, I tried for a while to list the quotations on an
interminable amount of stock, then I fell asleep in my swivel-chair.
Just before noon the phone woke me, and I started up with sweat
breaking out on my forehead. It was Jordan Baker; she often called me
up at this hour because the uncertainty of her own movements between
hotels and clubs and private houses made her hard to find in any other
way. Usually her voice came over the wire as something fresh and c€œHoweverâ€”I want to see you.â€

â€œI want to see you, too.â€

â€œSuppose I donâ€™t go to Southampton, and come into town this
afternoon?â€

â€œNoâ€”I donâ€™t think this afternoon.â€

â€œVery well.â€

â€œItâ€™s impossible this afternoon. Variousâ€”â€

We talked like that for a while, and then abruptly we werenâ€™t talking
any longer. I donâ€™t know which of us hung up with a sharp click, but I
know I didnâ€™t care. I couldnâ€™t have talked to her across a tea-table
that da the train that morning I had crossed
deliberately to the other side of the car. I supposed thereâ€™d be a
curious crowd around there all day with little boys searching for dark
spots in the dust, and some garrulous man telling over and over what
had happened, until it became less and less real even to him and he
could tell it no longer, and Myrtle Wilsonâ€™s tragic achievement was
forgotten. Now I want to go back a little and tell what happened at
the garage after we left there the nightrowd lapped up against the front
of the garage, while George Wilson rocked himself back and forth on
the couch inside. For a while the door of the office was open, and
everyone who came into the garage glanced irresistibly through it.
Finally someone said it was a shame, and closed the door. Michaelis
and several other men were with him; first, four or five men, later
two or three men. Still later Michaelis had to ask the last stranger
to wait there fifteen minutes longer, while he went blinched and began to cry â€œOh,
my God!â€ again in his groaning voice. Michaelis made a clumsy attempt
to distract him.

â€œHow long have you been married, George? Come on there, try and sit
still a minute, and answer my question. How long have you been
married?â€

â€œTwelve years.â€

â€œEver had any children? Come on, George, sit stillâ€”I asked you a
question. Did you ever have any children?â€

The hard brown beetles kept thudding against the dull light, and
whenever Michaeli long time? Maybe I could call up the church
and get a priest to come over and he could talk to you, see?â€

â€œDonâ€™t belong to any.â€

â€œYou ought to have a church, George, for times like this. You must
have gone to church once. Didnâ€™t you get married in a church? Listen,
George, listen to me. Didnâ€™t you get married in a church?â€

â€œThat was a long time ago.â€

The effort of answering broke the rhythm of his rockingâ€”for a moment
he was silent. Then the same half-knowiit was something funny.â€

â€œYou mean your wife bought it?â€

â€œShe had it wrapped in tissue paper on her bureau.â€

Michaelis didnâ€™t see anything odd in that, and he gave Wilson a dozen
reasons why his wife might have bought the dog-leash. But conceivably
Wilson had heard some of these same explanations before, from Myrtle,
because he began saying â€œOh, my God!â€ again in a whisperâ€”his comforter
left several explanations in the air.

â€œThen he killed her,â€ said Wilson.these trusting fellas and I
donâ€™t think any harm to nobody, but when I get to know a thing I know
it. It was the man in that car. She ran out to speak to him and he
wouldnâ€™t stop.â€

Michaelis had seen this too, but it hadnâ€™t occurred to him that there
was any special significance in it. He believed that Mrs. Wilson had
been running away from her husband, rather than trying to stop any
particular car.

â€œHow could she of been like that?â€

â€œSheâ€™s a deep one,â€ said Wilsnough outside to snap off the light.

Wilsonâ€™s glazed eyes turned out to the ash-heaps, where small grey
clouds took on fantastic shapes and scurried here and there in the
faint dawn wind.

â€œI spoke to her,â€ he muttered, after a long silence. â€œI told her she
might fool me but she couldnâ€™t fool God. I took her to the
windowâ€â€”with an effort he got up and walked to the rear window and
leaned with his face pressed against itâ€”â€œand I said â€˜God knows what
youâ€™ve been doiose to the window pane, nodding
into the twilight.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

By six oâ€™clock Michaelis was worn out, and grateful for the sound of a
car stopping outside. It was one of the watchers of the night before
who had promised to come back, so he cooked breakfast for three, which
he and the other man ate together. Wilson was quieter now, and
Michaelis went home to sleep; when he awoke four hours later and
hurried back to the garor three hours he disappeared
from view. The police, on the strength of what he said to Michaelis,
that he â€œhad a way of finding out,â€ supposed that he spent that time
going from garage to garage thereabout, inquiring for a yellow car. On
the other hand, no garage man who had seen him ever came forward, and
perhaps he had an easier, surer way of finding out what he wanted to
know. By half-past two he was in West Egg, where he asked someone the
way to Gatsbyâ€™s house. So by that time strange, because the
front right fender needed repair.

Gatsby shouldered the mattress and started for the pool. Once he
stopped and shifted it a little, and the chauffeur asked him if he
needed help, but he shook his head and in a moment disappeared among
the yellowing trees.

No telephone message arrived, but the butler went without his sleep
and waited for it until four oâ€™clockâ€”until long after there was anyone
to give it to if it came. I have an idea that Gatsby himself didnâ€™t â€¦ like that ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward
him through the amorphous trees.

The chauffeurâ€”he was one of Wolfshiemâ€™s protÃ©gÃ©sâ€”heard the
shotsâ€”afterwards he could only say that he hadnâ€™t thought anything
much about them. I drove from the station directly to Gatsbyâ€™s house
and my rushing anxiously up the front steps was the first thing that
alarmed anyone. But they knew then, I firmly believe. With scarcely a
word said, four of us, the chauffeur, butler, gardener,ansit, a thin red
circle in the water.

It was after we started with Gatsby toward the house that the gardener
saw Wilsonâ€™s body a little way off in the grass, and the holocaust was
complete.


                                  IX

After two years I remember the rest of that day, and that night and
the next day, only as an endless drill of police and photographers and
newspaper men in and out of Gatsbyâ€™s front door. A rope stretched
across the main gate and a policeman by it kephaelisâ€™s testimony at the inquest brought
to light Wilsonâ€™s suspicions of his wife I thought the whole tale
would shortly be served up in racy pasquinadeâ€”but Catherine, who might
have said anything, didnâ€™t say a word. She showed a surprising amount
of character about it tooâ€”looked at the coroner with determined eyes
under that corrected brow of hers, and swore that her sister had never
seen Gatsby, that her sister was completely happy with her husband,
that her sister had been ipractical question, was referred to me. At first I was surprised and
confused; then, as he lay in his house and didnâ€™t move or breathe or
speak, hour upon hour, it grew upon me that I was responsible, because
no one else was interestedâ€”interested, I mean, with that intense
personal interest to which everyone has some vague right at the end.

I called up Daisy half an hour after we found him, called her
instinctively and without hesitation. But she and Tom had gone away
early that afte
his office address on Broadway, and I called Information, but by the
time I had the number it was long after five, and no one answered the
phone.

â€œWill you ring again?â€

â€œIâ€™ve rung three times.â€

â€œItâ€™s very important.â€

â€œSorry. Iâ€™m afraid no oneâ€™s there.â€

I went back to the drawing-room and thought for an instant that they
were chance visitors, all these official people who suddenly filled
it. But, though they drew back the sheet and looked at Gatsby wirning I sent the butler to New York with a letter to Wolfshiem,
which asked for information and urged him to come out on the next
train. That request seemed superfluous when I wrote it. I was sure
heâ€™d start when he saw the newspapers, just as I was sure thereâ€™d be a
wire from Daisy before noonâ€”but neither a wire nor Mr. Wolfshiem
arrived; no one arrived except more police and photographers and
newspaper men. When the butler brought back Wolfshiemâ€™s answer I began
to have a feelinen
 I hear about a thing like this and am completely knocked down and
 out.

                               Yours truly

                             Meyer Wolfshiem

and then hasty addenda beneath:

 Let me know about the funeral etc do not know his family at all.

When the phone rang that afternoon and Long Distance said Chicago was
calling I thought this would be Daisy at last. But the connection came
through as a manâ€™s voice, very thin and far away.

â€œThis is Slagle speakMr.
Gatsby. Mr. Gatsbyâ€™s dead.â€

There was a long silence on the other end of the wire, followed by an
exclamation â€¦ then a quick squawk as the connection was broken.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think it was on the third day that a telegram signed Henry C. Gatz
arrived from a town in Minnesota. It said only that the sender was
leaving immediately and to postpone the funeral until he came.

It was Gatsbyâ€™s father, a solemn old mng hand.

â€œI saw it in the Chicago newspaper,â€ he said. â€œIt was all in the
Chicago newspaper. I started right away.â€

â€œI didnâ€™t know how to reach you.â€

His eyes, seeing nothing, moved ceaselessly about the room.

â€œIt was a madman,â€ he said. â€œHe must have been mad.â€

â€œWouldnâ€™t you like some coffee?â€ I urged him.

â€œI donâ€™t want anything. Iâ€™m all right now, Mr.â€”â€

â€œCarraway.â€

â€œWell, Iâ€™m all right now. Where have they got Jimmy?â€

ime and saw the height and splendour of the hall and the great
rooms opening out from it into other rooms, his grief began to be
mixed with an awed pride. I helped him to a bedroom upstairs; while he
took off his coat and vest I told him that all arrangements had been
deferred until he came.

â€œI didnâ€™t know what youâ€™d want, Mr. Gatsbyâ€”â€

â€œGatz is my name.â€

â€œâ€”Mr. Gatz. I thought you might want to take the body West.â€

He shook his head.

â€œJimmy always liked itered coverlet, trying to take it from the
bed, and lay down stifflyâ€”was instantly asleep.

That night an obviously frightened person called up, and demanded to
know who I was before he would give his name.

â€œThis is Mr. Carraway,â€ I said.

â€œOh!â€ He sounded relieved. â€œThis is Klipspringer.â€

I was relieved too, for that seemed to promise another friend at
Gatsbyâ€™s grave. I didnâ€™t want it to be in the papers and draw a
sightseeing crowd, so Iâ€™d been calling up a fewe?â€

â€œWell, the fact isâ€”the truth of the matter is that Iâ€™m staying with
some people up here in Greenwich, and they rather expect me to be with
them tomorrow. In fact, thereâ€™s a sort of picnic or something. Of
course Iâ€™ll do my best to get away.â€

I ejaculated an unrestrained â€œHuh!â€ and he must have heard me, for he
went on nervously:

â€œWhat I called up about was a pair of shoes I left there. I wonder if
itâ€™d be too much trouble to have the butler send them on. Ymorning of the funeral I went up to New York to see Meyer
Wolfshiem; I couldnâ€™t seem to reach him any other way. The door that I
pushed open, on the advice of an elevator boy, was marked â€œThe
Swastika Holding Company,â€ and at first there didnâ€™t seem to be anyone
inside. But when Iâ€™d shouted â€œhelloâ€ several times in vain, an
argument broke out behind a partition, and presently a lovely Jewess
appeared at an interior door and scrutinized me with black hostile
eyes.

â€œNobodck.â€

â€œBut I know heâ€™s there.â€

She took a step toward me and began to slide her hands indignantly up
and down her hips.

â€œYou young men think you can force your way in here any time,â€ she
scolded. â€œWeâ€™re getting sickantired of it. When I say heâ€™s in Chicago,
heâ€™s in Chicago.â€

I mentioned Gatsby.

â€œOh-h!â€ She looked at me over again. â€œWill you justâ€”What was your
name?â€

She vanished. In a moment Meyer Wolfshiem stood solemnly in the
doorway, holdor a
job. He hadnâ€™t eat anything for a couple of days. â€˜Come on have some
lunch with me,â€™ I said. He ate more than four dollarsâ€™ worth of food
in half an hour.â€

â€œDid you start him in business?â€ I inquired.

â€œStart him! I made him.â€

â€œOh.â€

â€œI raised him up out of nothing, right out of the gutter. I saw right
away he was a fine-appearing, gentlemanly young man, and when he told
me he was at Oggsford I knew I could use him good. I got him to join
the American

The hair in his nostrils quivered slightly, and as he shook his head
his eyes filled with tears.

â€œI canâ€™t do itâ€”I canâ€™t get mixed up in it,â€ he said.

â€œThereâ€™s nothing to get mixed up in. Itâ€™s all over now.â€

â€œWhen a man gets killed I never like to get mixed up in it in any
way. I keep out. When I was a young man it was differentâ€”if a friend
of mine died, no matter how, I stuck with them to the end. You may
think thatâ€™s sentimental, but I mean itâ€”to the bito West
Egg in a drizzle. After changing my clothes I went next door and found
Mr. Gatz walking up and down excitedly in the hall. His pride in his
son and in his sonâ€™s possessions was continually increasing and now he
had something to show me.

â€œJimmy sent me this picture.â€ He took out his wallet with trembling
fingers. â€œLook there.â€

It was a photograph of the house, cracked in the corners and dirty
with many hands. He pointed out every detail to me eagerly. â€œLook
there!ince he made a success he was very generous with me.â€

He seemed reluctant to put away the picture, held it for another
minute, lingeringly, before my eyes. Then he returned the wallet and
pulled from his pocket a ragged old copy of a book called Hopalong
Cassidy.

â€œLook here, this is a book he had when he was a boy. It just shows
you.â€

He opened it at the back cover and turned it around for me to see. On
the last flyleaf was printed the word schedule, and the date September
1         General Resolves

  * No wasting time at Shafters or [a name, indecipherable]

  * No more smokeing or chewing.

  * Bath every other day

  * Read one improving book or magazine per week

  * Save $5.00 [crossed out] $3.00 per week

  * Be better to parents

â€œI came across this book by accident,â€ said the old man. â€œIt just
shows you, donâ€™t it?â€

â€œIt just shows you.â€

â€œJimmy was bound to get ahead. He always had some resolves like this
or something. Dd the servants came in and
stood waiting in the hall, his eyes began to blink anxiously, and he
spoke of the rain in a worried, uncertain way. The minister glanced
several times at his watch, so I took him aside and asked him to wait
for half an hour. But it wasnâ€™t any use. Nobody came.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

About five oâ€™clock our procession of three cars reached the cemetery
and stopped in a thick drizzle beside the gateâ€”first months
before.

Iâ€™d never seen him since then. I donâ€™t know how he knew about the
funeral, or even his name. The rain poured down his thick glasses, and
he took them off and wiped them to see the protecting canvas unrolled
from Gatsbyâ€™s grave.

I tried to think about Gatsby then for a moment, but he was already
too far away, and I could only remember, without resentment, that
Daisy hadnâ€™t sent a message or a flower. Dimly I heard someone murmur
â€œBlessed are the dead that the-------------------------------------------

One of my most vivid memories is of coming back West from prep school
and later from college at Christmas time. Those who went farther than
Chicago would gather in the old dim Union Station at six oâ€™clock of a
December evening, with a few Chicago friends, already caught up into
their own holiday gaieties, to bid them a hasty goodbye. I remember
the fur coats of the girls returning from Miss This-or-Thatâ€™s and the
chatter of frozen breath atwinkle against the windows, and
the dim lights of small Wisconsin stations moved by, a sharp wild
brace came suddenly into the air. We drew in deep breaths of it as we
walked back from dinner through the cold vestibules, unutterably aware
of our identity with this country for one strange hour, before we
melted indistinguishably into it again.

Thatâ€™s my Middle Westâ€”not the wheat or the prairies or the lost Swede
towns, but the thrilling returning trains of my youth, and the street
ommon which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life.

Even when the East excited me most, even when I was most keenly aware
of its superiority to the bored, sprawling, swollen towns beyond the
Ohio, with their interminable inquisitions which spared only the
children and the very oldâ€”even then it had always for me a quality of
distortion. West Egg, especially, still figures in my more fantastic
dreams. I see it as a night scene by El Greco: a hundred houses, at
once conventional and â€™ power of correction. So when the blue smoke of brittle
leaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the
line I decided to come back home.

There was one thing to be done before I left, an awkward, unpleasant
thing that perhaps had better have been let alone. But I wanted to
leave things in order and not just trust that obliging and indifferent
sea to sweep my refuse away. I saw Jordan Baker and talked over and
around what had happened to us together, and what had 
pretended to be surprised. For just a minute I wondered if I wasnâ€™t
making a mistake, then I thought it all over again quickly and got up
to say goodbye.

â€œNevertheless you did throw me over,â€ said Jordan suddenly. â€œYou threw
me over on the telephone. I donâ€™t give a damn about you now, but it
was a new experience for me, and I felt a little dizzy for a while.â€

We shook hands.

â€œOh, and do you rememberâ€â€”she addedâ€”â€œa conversation we had once about
driving a car?ned away.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

One afternoon late in October I saw Tom Buchanan. He was walking ahead
of me along Fifth Avenue in his alert, aggressive way, his hands out a
little from his body as if to fight off interference, his head moving
sharply here and there, adapting itself to his restless eyes. Just as
I slowed up to avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning into
the windows of a jewellery store. Suddenly he saw me  grabbed my arm.

â€œI told him the truth,â€ he said. â€œHe came to the door while we were
getting ready to leave, and when I sent down word that we werenâ€™t in
he tried to force his way upstairs. He was crazy enough to kill me if
I hadnâ€™t told him who owned the car. His hand was on a revolver in his
pocket every minute he was in the houseâ€”â€ He broke off defiantly.
â€œWhat if I did tell him? That fellow had it coming to him. He threw
dust into your eyes just like he did in Daisyâhat he had done
was, to him, entirely justified. It was all very careless and
confused. They were careless people, Tom and Daisyâ€”they smashed up
things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their
vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let
other people clean up the mess they had made â€¦

I shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to, for I felt suddenly as
though I were talking to a child. Then he went into the jewellery
store to buy a , and perhaps he had made a story
about it all his own. I didnâ€™t want to hear it and I avoided him when
I got off the train.

I spent my Saturday nights in New York because those gleaming,
dazzling parties of his were with me so vividly that I could still
hear the music and the laughter, faint and incessant, from his garden,
and the cars going up and down his drive. One night I did hear a
material car there, and saw its lights stop at his front steps. But I
didnâ€™t investigate. Proba the sand.

Most of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any
lights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across the
Sound. And as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to
melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that
flowered once for Dutch sailorsâ€™ eyesâ€”a fresh, green breast of the new
world. Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsbyâ€™s
house, had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest on, and his dream
must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He
did not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that
vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic
rolled on under the night.

Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by
year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but thatâ€™s no
matterâ€”tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms further â€¦ And
one fine morningâ€”
