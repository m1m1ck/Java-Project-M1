CHAPTER I.
Down the Rabbit-Hole


Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into
the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or
conversations in it, â€œand what is the use of a book,â€ thought Alice
â€œwithout pictures or conversations?â€

So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of
making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
close by her.

There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it
so _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, â€œOh
dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!â€ (when she thought it over afterwards,
it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the
time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a
watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried
on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she
had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a
watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the
field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a
large rabbit-hole under the hedge.

In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how
in the world she was to get out again.

The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then
dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think
about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very
deep well.

Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had
plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what
was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out
what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she
looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with
cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures
hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she
passed; it was labelled â€œORANGE MARMALADEâ€, but to her great
disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear
of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the
cupboards as she fell past it.

â€œWell!â€ thought Alice to herself, â€œafter such a fall as this, I shall
think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave theyâ€™ll all think me
at home! Why, I wouldnâ€™t say anything about it, even if I fell off the
top of the house!â€ (Which was very likely true.)

Down, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? â€œI wonder how
many miles Iâ€™ve fallen by this time?â€ she said aloud. â€œI must be
getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would
be four thousand miles down, I thinkâ€”â€ (for, you see, Alice had learnt
several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and
though this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her
knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good
practice to say it over) â€œâ€”yes, thatâ€™s about the right distanceâ€”but
then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude Iâ€™ve got to?â€ (Alice had no
idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice
grand words to say.)

Presently she began again. â€œI wonder if I shall fall right _through_
the earth! How funny itâ€™ll seem to come out among the people that walk
with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I thinkâ€”â€ (she was rather
glad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didnâ€™t sound at all
the right word) â€œâ€”but I shall have to ask them what the name of the
country is, you know. Please, Maâ€™am, is this New Zealand or Australia?â€
(and she tried to curtsey as she spokeâ€”fancy _curtseying_ as youâ€™re
falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) â€œAnd what
an ignorant little girl sheâ€™ll think me for asking! No, itâ€™ll never do
to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.â€

Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began
talking again. â€œDinahâ€™ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!â€
(Dinah was the cat.) â€œI hope theyâ€™ll remember her saucer of milk at
tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are
no mice in the air, Iâ€™m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and thatâ€™s
very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?â€ And here
Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a
dreamy sort of way, â€œDo cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?â€ and
sometimes, â€œDo bats eat cats?â€ for, you see, as she couldnâ€™t answer
either question, it didnâ€™t much matter which way she put it. She felt
that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was
walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,
â€œNow, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?â€ when suddenly,
thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and
the fall was over.

Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:
she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another
long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down
it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind,
and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, â€œOh my ears
and whiskers, how late itâ€™s getting!â€ She was close behind it when she
turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found
herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging
from the roof.

There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when
Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every
door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to
get out again.

Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid
glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Aliceâ€™s
first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;
but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,
but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second
time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and
behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the
little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!

Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not
much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the
passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get
out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright
flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head
through the doorway; â€œand even if my head would go through,â€ thought
poor Alice, â€œit would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh,
how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only
knew how to begin.â€ For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had
happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things
indeed were really impossible.

There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went
back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at
any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this
time she found a little bottle on it, (â€œwhich certainly was not here
before,â€ said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper
label, with the words â€œDRINK ME,â€ beautifully printed on it in large
letters.

It was all very well to say â€œDrink me,â€ but the wise little Alice was
not going to do _that_ in a hurry. â€œNo, Iâ€™ll look first,â€ she said,
â€œand see whether itâ€™s marked â€˜_poison_â€™ or notâ€; for she had read
several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and
eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they
_would_ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:
such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long;
and that if you cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually
bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a
bottle marked â€œpoison,â€ it is almost certain to disagree with you,
sooner or later.

However, this bottle was _not_ marked â€œpoison,â€ so Alice ventured to
taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed
flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and
hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.

*      *      *      *      *      *      *

â€œWhat a curious feeling!â€ said Alice; â€œI must be shutting up like a
telescope.â€

And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face
brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going
through the little door into that lovely garden. First, howevaited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:
she felt a little out this; â€œfor it might end, you know,â€
said Alice to herself, â€œin my going out altike a candle. I
wonder what I should be like then?â€ And she tried to fancy what the
flandle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could
not remember ever having seen ng.

After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going
into the gnce; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the
door, she found she had forgotten the den key, and when she
went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reae could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her
best to climb up one ofof the table, but it was too slippery;
and when she had tired herself out with trying, thtle thing
sat down and cried.

â€œCome, thereâ€™s no use in crying like that!â€ said Arself,
rather sharply; â€œI advise you to leave off this minute!â€ She generally
gave hy good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),
and sometimes she scolded herself soas to bring tears into
her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for hated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,
for this curious childfond of pretending to be two people.
â€œBut itâ€™s no use now,â€ thought poor Alice, â€œ to be two
people! Why, thereâ€™s hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable
per
Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:
she opened it, an it a very small cake, on which the words
â€œEAT MEâ€ were beautifully marked in curranl, Iâ€™ll eat it,â€ said
Alice, â€œand if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; 
makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way Iâ€™ll
get into the gar donâ€™t care which happens!â€

She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, â€? Which
way?â€, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was
growin was quite surprised to find that she remained the same
size: to be sure, this generally en one eats cake, but Alice
had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-hings to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go
on in the common waye set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.

The Pool of Tears


â€œCuriouser and curiouser!â€ cried Alice (she was so ised, that
for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); â€œnow Iâ€™m
openke the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!â€
(for when she looked down at hhey seemed to be almost out of
sight, they were getting so far off). â€œOh, my poor littl
wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? Iâ€™m
sure _I_ shanâe! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble
myself about you: you must manage the bu can;â€”but I must be
kind to them,â€ thought Alice, â€œor perhaps they wonâ€™t walk thant to go! Let me see: Iâ€™ll give them a new pair of boots every
Christmas.â€

And shplanning to herself how she would manage it. â€œThey must
go by the carrier,â€ she thoug how funny itâ€™ll seem, sending
presents to oneâ€™s own feet! And how odd the directions!

     _Aliceâ€™s Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender,_ (_with
     Aliceâ€™s
Oh dear, what nonsense Iâ€™m talking!â€

Just then her head struck against the roof o: in fact she was
now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little goldenhurried off to the garden door.

Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down e, to
look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more
hopeless thhe sat down and began to cry again.

â€œYou ought to be ashamed of yourself,â€ said Alireat girl like
you,â€ (she might well say this), â€œto go on crying in this way! Stop
t, I tell you!â€ But she went on all the same, shedding
gallons of tears, until there wasool all round her, about
four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.

After a timd a little pattering of feet in the distance, and
she hastily dried her eyes to see what . It was the White
Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid glovesnd and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a
great hurry, muttering to hie came, â€œOh! the Duchess, the
Duchess! Oh! wonâ€™t she be savage if Iâ€™ve kept her wailice felt
so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the
Rabbit car, she began, in a low, timid voice, â€œIf you please,
sirâ€”â€ The Rabbit started violeped the white kid gloves and
the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he c
Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she
kept fanning herse time she went on talking: â€œDear, dear! How
queer everything is to-day! And yesterday t on just as usual.
I wonder if Iâ€™ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling
a little different. But if the same, the next question is, Who
in the world am I? Ah, _thatâ€™s_ the great puzzle!â€began
thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as
herself, to scould have been changed for any of them.

â€œIâ€™m sure Iâ€™m not Ada,â€ she said, â€œfr goes in such long
ringlets, and mine doesnâ€™t go in ringlets at all; and Iâ€™m sure I e Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a
very little! Besid™s_ she, and _Iâ€™m_ I, andâ€”oh dear, how
puzzling it all is! Iâ€™ll try if I know all tI used to know.
Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,
ames seven isâ€”oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that
rate! However, the Multiplica doesnâ€™t signify: letâ€™s try
Geography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is t of
Rome, and Romeâ€”no, _thatâ€™s_ all wrong, Iâ€™m certain! I must have been
changed fIâ€™ll try and say â€˜_How doth the little_â€”â€™â€ and she
crossed her hands on her lap were saying lessons, and began
to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, ads
did not come the same as they used to do:â€”

â€œHow doth the little crocodile
    s shining tail,
And pour the waters of the Nile
    On every golden scale!

â€œHow che seems to grin,
    How neatly spread his claws,
And welcome little fishes in
    With ling jaws!â€


â€œIâ€™m sure those are not the right words,â€ said poor Alice, and helled with tears again as she went on, â€œI must be Mabel after all, and
I shall have to g in that poky little house, and have next to
no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many llearn! No, Iâ€™ve
made up my mind about it; if Iâ€™m Mabel, Iâ€™ll stay down here! Itâ€™lse their putting their heads down and saying â€˜Come up again, dear!â€™
I shall only looky â€˜Who am I then? Tell me that first, and
then, if I like being that person, Iâ€™ll comot, Iâ€™ll stay down
here till Iâ€™m somebody elseâ€™â€”but, oh dear!â€ cried Alice, wit
burst of tears, â€œI do wish they _would_ put their heads down! I am so
_very_ tired of alone here!â€

As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see had put on one of the Rabbitâ€™s little white kid gloves while
she was talking. â€œHow _e done that?â€ she thought. â€œI must be
growing small again.â€ She got up and went to to measure
herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was
now abou high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon
found out that the cause of this was e was holding, and she
dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogethehat _was_ a narrow escape!â€ said Alice, a good deal frightened at the
sudden change, bud to find herself still in existence; â€œand
now for the garden!â€ and she ran with all  to the little
door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden
keg on the glass table as before, â€œand things are worse than
ever,â€ thought the poor chr I never was so small as this
before, never! And I declare itâ€™s too bad, that it is!â€e said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment,
splash! she was up to her chiwater. Her first idea was that
she had somehow fallen into the sea, â€œand in that case Ick by
railway,â€ she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in
her life, me to the general conclusion, that wherever you go
to on the English coast you find a numhing machines in the
sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a roing houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she
soon made out that she was i of tears which she had wept when
she was nine feet high.

â€œI wish I hadnâ€™t cried s said Alice, as she swam about, trying
to find her way out. â€œI shall be punished for itppose, by
being drowned in my own tears! That _will_ be a queer thing, to be
sure! Howevhing is queer to-day.â€

Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a lioff, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought
it must be a walrupotamus, but then she remembered how small
she was now, and she soon made out that it wasuse that had
slipped in like herself.

â€œWould it be of any use, now,â€ thought Aliceeak to this mouse?
Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very
lan talk: at any rate, thereâ€™s no harm in trying.â€ So she
began: â€œO Mouse, do you kn out of this pool? I am very tired
of swimming about here, O Mouse!â€ (Alice thought thithe right
way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but
she reaving seen in her brotherâ€™s Latin Grammar, â€œA mouseâ€”of
a mouseâ€”to a mouseâ€”a mouse!â€) The Mouse looked at her rather
inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one tle eyes,
but it said nothing.

â€œPerhaps it doesnâ€™t understand English,â€ thought I daresay itâ€™s
a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.â€ (For, with alledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago
anything had happened.) So sgain: â€œOÃ¹ est ma chatte?â€ which
was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. Thve a
sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with
fright. â€œOh, I brdon!â€ cried Alice hastily, afraid that she
had hurt the poor animalâ€™s feelings. â€œIgot you didnâ€™t like
cats.â€

â€œNot like cats!â€ cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passce. â€œWould
_you_ like cats if you were me?â€

â€œWell, perhaps not,â€ said Alice ing tone: â€œdonâ€™t be angry
about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I thd
take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear
quiet thing,â€ Ali, half to herself, as she swam lazily about
in the pool, â€œand she sits purring so nicelire, licking her
paws and washing her faceâ€”and she is such a nice soft thing to
nurseâ€™s such a capital one for catching miceâ€”oh, I beg your
pardon!â€ cried Alice again, fme the Mouse was bristling all
over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. â€œ talk
about her any more if youâ€™d rather not.â€

â€œWe indeed!â€ cried the Mouse, wmbling down to the end of his
tail. â€œAs if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our familyhated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Donâ€™t let me hear the name
again!â€

â€œI woed!â€ said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of
conversation. â€œAre youâ€”adâ€”ofâ€”of dogs?â€ The Mouse did not
answer, so Alice went on eagerly: â€œThere is suchttle dog near
our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you
kno, such long curly brown hair! And itâ€™ll fetch things when
you throw them, and itâ€™ll sbeg for its dinner, and all sorts
of thingsâ€”I canâ€™t remember half of themâ€”and it be farmer, you
know, and he says itâ€™s so useful, itâ€™s worth a hundred pounds! He says
ll the rats andâ€”oh dear!â€ cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,
â€œIâ€™m afraid Iâ€™ve offgain!â€ For the Mouse was swimming away
from her as hard as it could go, and making quition in the
pool as it went.

So she called softly after it, â€œMouse dear! Do come backd we
wonâ€™t talk about cats or dogs either, if you donâ€™t like them!â€ When the
Mouses, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face
was quite pale (with passion, Alt), and it said in a low
trembling voice, â€œLet us get to the shore, and then Iâ€™ll telhistory, and youâ€™ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.â€

It was high time tohe pool was getting quite crowded with the
birds and animals that had fallen into it: theDuck and a
Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice
led th the whole party swam to the shore.




CHAPTER III.
A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale
ere indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bankâ€”the
birds with draggled fea animals with their fur clinging close
to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomforThe first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a
consultation about thier a few minutes it seemed quite
natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly withif
she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument
with the Lory,st turned sulky, and would only say, â€œI am
older than you, and must know better;â€ ande would not allow
without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused toage, there was no more to be said.

At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authg them,
called out, â€œSit down, all of you, and listen to me! _Iâ€™ll_ soon make
you dr€ They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the
Mouse in the middle. Alice kept hxiously fixed on it, for she
felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry 

â€œAhem!â€ said the Mouse with an important air, â€œare you all ready? This
is the dg I know. Silence all round, if you please! â€˜William
the Conqueror, whose cause was favhe pope, was soon submitted
to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late mtomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of
Mercia and Northumbriaâ€
â€œUgh!â€ said the Lory, with a shiver.

â€œI beg your pardon!â€ said the Mouse, frowvery politely: â€œDid
you speak?â€

â€œNot I!â€ said the Lory hastily.

â€œI thoughâ€ said the Mouse. â€œâ€”I proceed. â€˜Edwin and Morcar,
the earls of Mercia and Northumared for him: and even
Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisabl

â€œFound _what_?â€ said the Duck.

â€œFound _it_,â€ the Mouse replied rather crosscourse you know
what â€˜itâ€™ means.â€

â€œI know what â€˜itâ€™ means well enough, whe a thing,â€ said the
Duck: â€œitâ€™s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what dchbishop find?â€

The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, â€œâ€˜it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him
the crown. Williamâ€ at first was moderate. But the insolence
of his Normansâ€”â€™ How are you getting on nowâ€ it continued,
turning to Alice as it spoke.

â€œAs wet as ever,â€ said Alice in a  tone: â€œit doesnâ€™t seem to
dry me at all.â€

â€œIn that case,â€ said the Dodo soling to its feet, â€œI move
that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more eremediesâ€”â€

â€œSpeak English!â€ said the Eaglet. â€œI donâ€™t know the meaning of h long words, and, whatâ€™s more, I donâ€™t believe you do either!â€ And
the Eaglet bent ead to hide a smile: some of the other birds
tittered audibly.

â€œWhat I was going to id the Dodo in an offended tone, â€œwas,
that the best thing to get us dry would be a Cau€

â€œWhat _is_ a Caucus-race?â€ said Alice; not that she wanted much to
know, but th paused as if it thought that _somebody_ ought to
speak, and no one else seemed inclined thing.

â€œWhy,â€ said the Dodo, â€œthe best way to explain it is to do it.â€ (And,
at like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will
tell you how the Dodo managed ist it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (â€œthe exact
shape doesnâ€™t matterid,) and then all the party were placed
along the course, here and there. There was no â€ three, and
away,â€ but they began running when they liked, and left off when they
like it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,
when they had been running halfr so, and were quite dry
again, the Dodo suddenly called out â€œThe race is over!â€ and crowded round it, panting, and asking, â€œBut who has won?â€

This question the Dodo coswer without a great deal of
thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the
pictures of him), whit waited in silence. At last the Dodo
said, â€œ_Everybody_ has won, and all must have pri
â€œBut who is to give the prizes?â€ quite a chorus of voices asked.

â€œWhy, _she_, of said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one
finger; and the whole party at once crowded rcalling out in a
confused way, â€œPrizes! Prizes!â€

Alice had no idea what to do, andr she put her hand in her
pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt wate got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly
one a-piece, all round. she must have a prize herself, you know,â€ said the Mouse.

â€œOf course,â€ the Dodo ry gravely. â€œWhat else have you got in
your pocket?â€ he went on, turning to Alice.
 thimble,â€ said Alice sadly.

â€œHand it over here,â€ said the Dodo.

Then they allound her once more, while the Dodo solemnly
presented the thimble, saying â€œWe beg your  of this elegant
thimble;â€ and, when it had finished this short speech, they all
cheerce thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave
that she did not dar; and, as she could not think of anything
to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble,s solemn as
she could.

The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise aion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste
theirs, and the small ones chad to be patted on the back.
However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a 
begged the Mouse to tell them something more.

â€œYou promised to tell me your history,â€ said Alice, â€œand why
it is you hateâ€”C and D,â€ she added in a whisper, half afra
would be offended again.

â€œMine is a long and a sad tale!â€ said the Mouse, turning and
sighing.

â€œIt _is_ a long tail, certainly,â€ said Alice, looking down with wond Mouseâ€™s tail; â€œbut why do you call it sad?â€ And she kept on
puzzling about it while was speaking, so that her idea of the
tale was something like this:â€”

         â€œFo a mouse, That he met in the house, â€˜Let us both
         go to law: _I_ will prosecut”Come, Iâ€™ll take no
         denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning Iâ€™   nothing to do.â€™ Said the mouse to the cur, â€˜Such a trial, dear
         sir, With  judge, would be wasting our breath.â€™
         â€˜Iâ€™ll be judge, Iâ€™ll be jury,â€™ Sg old Fury: â€˜Iâ€™ll
         try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.â€™â€

â€ot attending!â€ said the Mouse to Alice severely. â€œWhat are
you thinking of?â€

â€œ pardon,â€ said Alice very humbly: â€œyou had got to the fifth
bend, I think?â€

â€œI_â€ cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.

â€œA knot!â€ said Alice, always ready rself useful, and looking
anxiously about her. â€œOh, do let me help to undo it!â€

â€o nothing of the sort,â€ said the Mouse, getting up and
walking away. â€œYou insult me bsuch nonsense!â€

â€œI didnâ€™t mean it!â€ pleaded poor Alice. â€œBut youâ€™re so easid,
you know!â€

The Mouse only growled in reply.

â€œPlease come back and finish you Alice called after it; and
the others all joined in chorus, â€œYes, please do!â€ but tnly
shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.

â€œWhat a pity it wouldnâ€ sighed the Lory, as soon as it was
quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportaying to
her daughter â€œAh, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose
_your_ tâ€œHold your tongue, Ma!â€ said the young Crab, a little
snappishly. â€œYouâ€™re enough  patience of an oyster!â€

â€œI wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!â€ said Alice aressing norticular. â€œSheâ€™d soon fetch it back!â€

â€œAnd who is Dinah, ifenture to estion?â€ said the
Lory.

Alice replied eagerly, for she was alway talk abou
â€œDinahâ€™s our cat. And sheâ€™s such a capital one for catching minâ€™t thin I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,
sheâ€™ll eat a littleoon as loo

This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some ods hurriedce: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very
carefully, remarkinglly must bhome; the night-air
doesnâ€™t suit my throat!â€ and a Canary called rembling vts children, â€œCome away, my dears! Itâ€™s high time you were all inn various hey all moved off, and Alice was soon left
alone.

â€œI wish I hadnoned Dinahaid to herself in a melancholy
tone. â€œNobody seems to like her, dowd Iâ€™m su the best
cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ev
any moreere poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very
lonely and low-sn a littlewever, she again heard a
little pattering of footsteps in the distanc looked up half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was
coming back his story
CHAPTER IV.
The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill


It was the White otting slogain, and looking
anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost sometshe hearding to itself â€œThe Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh
my furers! Sheâ€ executed, as sure as ferrets are
ferrets! Where _can_ I have droppedonder?â€ sed in a
moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of whitees, and shd-naturedly began hunting about for them, but
they were nowhere to beerything save changed since
her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the e and theor, had vanished completely.

Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, ashunting abcalled out to her in an angry tone, â€œWhy, Mary Ann, what _are_ you
here? Run moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and
a fan! Quick, now!â€ And Ao much friat she ran off
at once in the direction it pointed to, without tryingn the
misd made.

â€œHe took me for his housemaid,â€ she said to herself as €œHow
sur€™ll be when he finds out who I am! But Iâ€™d better take him
his fansâ€”that in find them.â€ As she said this, she
came upon a neat little house, r of whichght brass
plate with the name â€œW. RABBIT,â€ engraved upon it. She thout
kno hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the
real Mary A turned ououse before she had found the
fan and gloves.

â€œHow queer it seeme said to €œto be going messages for
a rabbit! I suppose Dinahâ€™ll be sending ages next!e
began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: â€œâ€˜Miss Alicere directt ready for your walk!â€™ â€˜Coming in a minute,
nurse! But Iâ€™ve gohat the mo€™t get out.â€™ Only I
donâ€™t think,â€ Alice went on, â€œthat theyânah stop ie
if it began ordering people about like that!â€

By this time she her way i little room with a table
in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) two or th of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the
glovs just goie the room, when her eye fell upon a
little bottle that stood near thglass. Thelabel
this time with the words â€œDRINK ME,â€ but nevertheless she u
and put lips. â€œI know _something_ interesting is sure to
happen,â€ she sailf, â€œwhet or drink anything; so
Iâ€™ll just see what this bottle does. I do hl make me 
again, for really Iâ€™m quite tired of being such a tiny little thint did so i much sooner than she had expected: before she had
drunk half the botound her hng against the ceiling,
and had to stoop to save her neck from being e hastily the bottle, saying to herself â€œThatâ€™s quite enoughâ€”I hope I shan any moreâ, I canâ€™t get out at the doorâ€”I do wish I hadnâ€™t
drunk quite so

Alas! ilate to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,
and very soon ha down on tin another minute there
was not even room for this, and she tried the lying dowe elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.
Stnt on growas a last resource, she put one arm out
of the window, and one foot uney, and sself â€œNow I
can do no more, whatever happens. What _will_ become of
Luckily fthe little magic bottle had now had its full effect,
and she grew no ill it wasmfortable, and, as there
seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever g of the ro no wonder she felt unhappy.

â€œIt was much pleasanter at home,â€ or Alice, e wasnâ€™t
always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered aboutnd
rabbitt wish I hadnâ€™t gone down that rabbit-holeâ€”and yetâ€”and
yetâ€”itr curious, this sort of life! I do wonder what
_can_ have happened to me! When read fairyfancied
that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the mone! Therebe a book written about me, that there ought! And
when I grow up, Iâ€oneâ€”but n up now,â€ she added in a
sorrowful tone; â€œat least thereâ€™s no ow up any _.â€

â€œBut then,â€ thought Alice, â€œshall I _never_ get any oldam
now? Te a comfort, one wayâ€”never to be an old womanâ€”but
thenâ€”always tsons to le shouldnâ€™t like _that!_â€

â€œOh, you foolish Alice!â€ she answef. â€œHow arn
lessons in here? Why, thereâ€™s hardly room for _you_, and no roofor any le!â€

And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, g quite a on of it altogether; but after a few minutes
she heard a voice outsidpped to li€œMary Ann! Mary Ann!â€ said the voice. â€œFetch me my gloves this moThen came attering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was
the Rabbit coming t her, and ed till she shook the
house, quite forgetting that she was now about  times asthe Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.

Presently the Rabp to the dried to open it; but, as
the door opened inwards, and Aliceâ€™s elbowed hard ag
that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself â€œThen Iround and the window.â€

â€œ_That_ you wonâ€™t!â€ thought Alice, and, after ll she fanheard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her
hade a snatair. She did not get hold of anything,
but she heard a little shriek , and a crken glass,
from which she concluded that it was just possible it had o a
cucum or something of the sort.

Next came an angry voiceâ€”the Rabbitâ€™! Pat! Whe?â€ And
then a voice she had never heard before, â€œSure then Iâ€™m ing
for a honour!â€

â€œDigging for apples, indeed!â€ said the Rabbit angrie! Come an out of _this!_â€ (Sounds of more broken glass.)

â€œNow tell me, P™s that inw?â€

â€œSure, itâ€™s an arm, yer honour!â€ (He pronounced it â€œa

â€œAn aose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole
window!â€
 it does, : but itâ€™s an arm for all that.â€

â€œWell, itâ€™s got no businest any rateake it away!â€

There was a long silence after this, and Alice coulr whispersthen; such as, â€œSure, I donâ€™t like it, yer honour, at all, at
all as I tellcoward!â€ and at last she spread out her
hand again, and made anothen the air. there were
_two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. â€mber
of cames there must be!â€ thought Alice. â€œI wonder what
theyâ€™ll do nr pulling the window, I only wish they
_could!_ Iâ€™m sure _I_ donâ€™t want to re any lon
She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came g of littlls, and the sound of a good many voices all
talking together: she madwords: â€œthe other
ladder?â€”Why, I hadnâ€™t to bring but one; Billâ€™s got thBill!
fet, lad!â€”Here, put â€™em up at this cornerâ€”No, tie â€™em

youâ€™re to go down the chimney!â€

â€œOh! So Billâ€™s g down the as he?â€ said Alice to
herself. â€œShy, they seem to put everything  I wouldnâ
Billâ€™s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure;hink_ I caittle!â€

She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, atill
she ttle animal (she couldnâ€™t guess of what sort it was)
scratching andg about iney close above her: then,
saying to herself â€œThis is Bill,â€ she garp kick, 
to see what would happen next.

The first thing she heard was a geus of â€œTBill!â€
then the Rabbitâ€™s voice alongâ€”â€œCatch him, you by the hhen
silenen another confusion of voicesâ€”â€œHold up his headâ€”Brandy
nowâ€”Dke himâ€”H old fellow? What happened to you? Tell
us all about it!â€

Last cle feeble, voice, (â€œThatâ€™s Bill,â€ thought
Alice,) â€œWell, I hardly knowâ thank ye;ter nowâ€”but Iâ€™m
a deal too flustered to tell youâ€”all I know is, comes at  Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!â€

â€œSo you didow!â€ sairs.

â€œWe must burn the house down!â€ said the Rabbitâ€™s voice; acalled outs she could, â€œIf you do, Iâ€™ll set Dinah at you!â€

There was a ce instantice thought to herself, â€œI
wonder what they _will_ do next! If theyense, theythe
roof off.â€ After a minute or two, they began moving about againce heard tsay, â€œA barrowful will do, to begin with.â€

â€œA barrowful of _whought Alie had not long to doubt,
for the next moment a shower of little pebblttling in ndow, and some of them hit her in the face. â€œIâ€™ll put a stop to

again!â€ which producedead silence noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into
es as theye floor, and a bright idea came into her
head. â€œIf I eat one of the€ she thotâ€™s sure to make
_some_ change in my size; and as it canâ€™t possib larger, ike me smaller, I suppose.â€

So she swallowed one of the cakes, andhted to fie
began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get
t door, shef the house, and found quite a crowd of
little animals and birds waite. The pooizard, Bill,
was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, whong it
som of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she
appeared; n off as h could, and soon found herself
safe in a thick wood.

â€œThe first ve got to d Alice to herself, as she
wandered about in the wood, â€œis to grow t size agae
second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think tha the best 
It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply
the only dwas, that she had not the smallest idea
how to set about it; and whilpeering absly among
the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her  a
great An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and
etching ou trying to touch her. â€œPoor little
thing!â€ said Alice, in a coaxind she tri whistle to
it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the tt it
mighy, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in
spite of aling.

Hang what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and
held it outppy; whereuppy jumped into the air off
all its feet at once, with a yelp of delrushed at 
and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistep herselfg run over; and the moment she appeared on the
other side, the puppy er rush at, and tumbled head
over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Aling it wase having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every
momentmpled unde, ran round the thistle again; then
the puppy began a series of shortt the stic a very
little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barkin
all the l at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with
its tongue hangints mouth, eat eyes half shut.

This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for makcape; so sf at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath,
and tipyâ€™s barquite faint in the distance.

â€œAnd yet what a dear little puppy itaid Alice,ant
against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one aves: â€œIve liked teaching it tricks very much, ifâ€”if Iâ€™d

queshat?â€
 question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at
the flowe blades out she did not see anything that
looked like the right thing to eat oder the cis.
There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same heightlf; and wh looked under it, and on both sides of it, and
behind it, it occurredat she mig look and see what
was on the top of it.

She stretched herself up  and peepe edge of the
mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large rpillar, ttting on the top with its arms folded, quietly
smoking a long hookah,g not the otice of her or of
anything else.




CHAPTER V.
Advice from a r


Thear and Alice looked at each other for some time in
silence: at last tllar took  out of its mouth, and
addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.

â_you?_â€ aterpillar.

This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation.lied,
rat â€œIâ€”I hardly know, sir, just at presentâ€”at least I know
who I _I got up tg, but I think I must have been
changed several times since then.â€ do you me?â€ said the Caterpillar sternly. â€œExplain
yourself!â€

â€œI caain _myselafraid, sir,â€ said Alice, â€œbecause Iâ€™m
not myself, you see.â€nâ€™t see,he Caterpillar.

â€œIâ€™m afraid I canâ€™t put it more clearly,â€ Aed very po€œfor I canâ€™t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many sizes in ery confusing.â€

â€œIt isnâ€™t,â€ said the Caterpillar.

â€œWel you haven it so yet,â€ said Alice; â€œbut when you
have to turn into a chrysawill some nowâ€”and then
after that into a butterfly, I should think youâ€™ll fittle
quet you?â€

â€œNot a bit,â€ said the Caterpillar.

â€œWell, perhaplings may nt,â€ said Alice; â€œall I know
is, it would feel very queer to _me_œYou!â€ sterpillar contemptuously. â€œWho are _you?_â€

Which brought them bto the begthe conversation.
Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillarâ€™uch _very_marks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, â€œI
think, yo tell me wre, first.â€

â€œWhy?â€ said the Caterpillar.

Here was another uestion; ae could not think of any
good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed t_very_ unptate of mind, she turned away.

â€œCome back!â€ the Caterpillar calher. â€œIâhing
important to say!â€

This sounded promising, certainly: Aliced came bac
â€œKeep your temper,â€ said the Caterpillar.

â€œIs that all?â€ , swallowir anger as well as she
could.

â€œNo,â€ said the Caterpillar.

Aht she mig wait, as she had nothing else to do,
and perhaps after all it might omething wng. For
some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it its arms, ookah out of its mouth again, and said, â€œSo you
think youâ€™re chanu?â€

âraid I am, sir,â€ said Alice; â€œI canâ€™t remember things as I
usedonâ€™t kee size for ten minutes together!â€

â€œCanâ€™t remember _what_ thing the Cater
â€œWell, Iâ€™ve tried to say â€œHow doth the little busy bee,â€ but me differece replied in a very melancholy voice.

â€œRepeat, â€œ_You are old, liam_,â€™âe Caterpillar.

Alice folded her hands, and began:â€”

â€œYou are r William,ung man said,
    â€œAnd your hair has become very white;
And yet yotly stand adâ€”

Do you thinsten all d stuff?
    Be off, or Iâ€™ll kick you down stairs!â€


â€œThat i right,â€Caterpillar.

â€œNot _quite_ right, Iâ€™m afraid,â€ said Alice, timome of theve got altered.â€

â€œIt is wrong from beginning to end,â€ said thlar decidethere was silence for some minutes.

The Caterpillar was the first t
â€œWhat u want to be?â€ it asked.

â€œOh, Iâ€™m not particular as to size,âastily repnly one
doesnâ€™t like changing so often, you know.â€

â€œI _donâ€€ said thlar.

Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in
before, at that she was losing her temper.

â€œAre you content now?â€ said tllar.

âshould like to be a _little_ larger, sir, if you wouldnâ€™t
mind,â€ : â€œthree such a wretched height to be.â€

â€œIt is a very good height indee the Caterrily,
rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches
â€œBut Iâed to it!â€ pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she
thought ofâ€œI wish res wouldnâ€™t be so easily
offended!â€

â€œYouâ€™ll get used to iâ€ said tllar; and it put the
hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.
e Alice wantly until it chose to speak again. In a
minute or two the Caterpilla hookah ououth and
yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down offroom, and ay in the grass, merely remarking as it went,
â€œOne side will make yller, and side will make you
grow shorter.â€

â€œOne side of _what?_ The oth _what?_â€Alice to
herself.

â€œOf the mushroom,â€ said the Caterpillar, juse had asked; and in another moment it was out of sight.

Alice remained lookinully at th for a minute,
trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and
perfectlhe found this a very difficult question. However, at
last she stretchs round it they would go, and broke
off a bit of the edge with each hand.

â€hich is whe said to herself, and nibbled a little of
the right-hand bit to try : the nexte felt a
violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!
 good deald by this very sudden change, but she felt
that there was no time to s she was rapidly; so she
set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Herpressed
sagainst her foot, that there was hardly room to open her
mouth; but sat last, a to swallow a morsel of the
lefthand bit.

â€œCadâ€™s free at last!â€ said Alice in a tone of delight, which
changerm in anot, when she found that her shoulders
were nowhere to be found: all she, when shewn, was
an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk sea of grethat lay far below her.

â€œWhat _can_ all that green stuff be?â€ s â€œAnd wh my
shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I canâ€™t see he was movbout as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,
except a little shg the distleaves.

As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to 
she triedr head down to them, and was delighted to find that
her neck would beasily in aon, like a serpent. She
had just succeeded in curving it down into a igzag, andg to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but
the e trees unshe had been wandering, when a sharp
hiss made her draw back in a hure pigeon hnto her
face, and was beating her violently with its wings.

â€œSercreamed th

â€œIâ€™m _not_ a serpent!â€ said Alice indignantly. â€œLet me alon€œSerpent,in!â€ repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued
tone, and added witf sob, â€œed every way, and nothing
seems to suit them!â€

â€œI havenâ€™t thea what yoking about,â€ said Alice.

â€œIâ€™ve tried the roots of trees, and ed banks,  tried
hedges,â€ the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; â€œbuerpents! To pleasing them!â€

Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thoughs no use ianything more till the Pigeon had finished.

â€œAs if it wasnâ€™t trgh hatchin,â€ said the Pigeon;
â€œbut I must be on the look-out for serpents nay! Why, It had a wink of sleep these three weeks!â€

â€œIâ€™m very sorry you annoyed,âice, who was beginning to
see its meaning.

â€œAnd just as Iâ€™d taghest treeod,â€ continued the
Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, â€œand jus thinking be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down
from th, Serpent!But Iâ€™m _not_ a serpent, I tell you!â€ said Alice. â€œIâ€™m aâ€”Iâ€

â€œWelare you?â€ said the Pigeon. â€œI can see youâ€™re trying to
invent s€

â€œI little girl,â€ said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered
the changes se through that day.

â€œA likely story indeed!â€ said the Pigeon in the deepept. â€œIâ€™ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never
_onch a neck o, no! Youâ€™re a serpent; and thereâ€™s
no use denying it. I supposebe tellinghat you never
tasted an egg!â€

â€œI _have_ tasted eggs, certainlyAlice, whoy truthful
child; â€œbut little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpeu
know.â€donâ€™t believe it,â€ said the Pigeon; â€œbut if they do, why then
t kind of satâ€™s all I can say.â€

This was such a new idea to Alice, that she silent fte or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, â€œYouâ€™r for eggs,hat_ well enough; and what does it matter to
me whether youâ€™re a lior a serpeâ€œIt matters a good deal to _me_,â€ said Alice hastily; â€œbut Iâ€™ming for eghappens; and if I was, I shouldnâ€™t want
_yours_: I donâ€™t like the

â€œWellthen!â€ said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled
down again int. Alice cwn among the trees as well
as she could, for her neck kept getting enong the brnd every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while
sred that seld the pieces of mushroom in her hands,
and she set to work very carbbling firand then at
the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shol
she had in bringing herself down to her usual height.

It was so long sinceeen anythie right size, that it
felt quite strange at first; but she got used tfew minutegan talking to herself, as usual. â€œCome, thereâ€™s half my plan
don puzzling changes are! Iâ€™m never sure what Iâ€™m
going to be, from one minuter! Howeverot back to my
right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautif€”how
_isbe done, I wonder?â€ As she said this, she came suddenly
upon an opeith a littn it about four feet high.
â€œWhoever lives there,â€ thought Alice,  never do on them
_this_ size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!â€began nibbe righthand bit again, and did not venture to go
near the house till ought herso nine inches high.




CHAPTER VI.
Pig and Pepper


For a mio she stooat the house, and wondering what
to do next, when suddenly a footman came runnithe
woodâ€”(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livewise, judg face only, she would have called him a
fish)â€”and rapped loudly at ith his kn was opened by
another footman in livery, with a round face, and large a
frog;footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled
all over their  felt veryo know what it was all
about, and crept a little way out of the wood 

The Fi began by producing from under his arm a great letter,
nearly as larglf, and thed over to the other,
saying, in a solemn tone, â€œFor the Duchess. Aon from tho play croquet.â€ The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn
tonenging the he words a little, â€œFrom the Queen.
An invitation for the Duchess tquet.â€
y both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.

Alice lauch at this had to run back into the wood
for fear of their hearing her; and whe peeped ouh-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the
ing stupid the sky.

Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.

â€œThesort of using,â€ said the Footman, â€œand that for
two reasons. First, becausethe same s door as you
are; secondly, because theyâ€™re making such a noise inse could
par you.â€ And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary
noise goingâ€”a constg and sneezing, and every now
and then a great crash, as if a dish ord been broeces.

â€œPlease, then,â€ said Alice, â€œhow am I to get in?â€

ight be son your knocking,â€ the Footman went on
without attending to her, â€œthe door b For instance,
if you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could letyou
know. looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and
this Aliceecidedly uœBut perhaps he canâ€™t help it,â€
she said to herself; â€œhis eyes ry_ nearlyp of his
head. But at any rate he might answer questions.â€”How am I â€
she rloud.

â€œI shall sit here,â€ the Footman remarked, â€œtill tomorro
At this mdoor of the house opened, and a large plate came
skimming out, straigFootmanâ€™ just grazed his nose,
and broke to pieces against one of the trees b

â€œâ€”y, maybe,â€ the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly
as if nohappened.am I to get in?â€ asked Alice again, in a louder tone.

â€œ_Are_ yon at all?âe Footman. â€œThatâ€™s the first
question, you know.â€

It was, noly Alice de to be told so. â€œItâ€™s really
dreadful,â€ she muttered to herselway all ths argue.
Itâ€™s enough to drive one crazy!â€

The Footman seemed tis a good y for repeating his
remark, with variations. â€œI shall sit here,â€ €œon and oays and days.â€

â€œBut what am _I_ to do?â€ said Alice.

â€œAnylike,â€ sotman, and began whistling.

â€œOh, thereâ€™s no use in talking to hd Alice de â€œheâ€™s
perfectly idiotic!â€ And she opened the door and went in.or led riglarge kitchen, which was full of smoke from
one end to the other: theas sittinge-legged stool
in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning ove,
stirri cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.

â€œThereâ€™s certainly tpper in th Alice said to
herself, as well as she could for sneezing.

There nly too mun the air. Even the Duchess sneezed
occasionally; and as for the babyneezing an
alternately without a momentâ€™s pause. The only things in the kitched not sneehe cook, and a large cat which was sitting
on the hearth and grinningto ear.
 would you tell me,â€ said Alice, a little timidly, for she was
not  whether i manners for her to speak first, â€œwhy
your cat grins like that?â€™s a Chesh said the Duchess, â€œand thatâ€™s why. Pig!â€

She said the last such sudde that Alice quite
jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was ao the
bab to her, so she took courage, and went on again:â€”

â€œI didnâ€™t kheshire cagrinned; in fact, I didnâ€™t
know that cats _could_ grin.â€

â€œTh,â€ said s; â€œand most of â€™em do.â€

â€œI donâ€™t know of any that do,â€d very polling quite
pleased to have got into a conversation.

â€œYou donâ€™t,â€ said s; â€œand thatâ€™s a fact.â€

Alice did not at all like the tone ofrk, and thould
be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. Whil trying toe, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the
fire, and at once set towing everhin her reach at
the Duchess and the babyâ€”the fire-irons came firstlowed a
saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of
them even hit her; by was howling so much already,
that it was quite impossible to say w blows hurt.

â€œOh, _please_ mind what youâ€™re doing!â€ cried Alice, jumpinown
in anterror. â€œOh, there goes his _precious_ nose!â€ as an
unusually larn flew cloand very nearly carried it
off.

â€œIf everybody minded their own b the Duchn a hoarse
growl, â€œthe world would go round a deal faster than it d
â€œWhich _ be an advantage,â€ said Alice, who felt very glad to
get an opporthowing offof her knowledge. â€œJust
think of what work it would make with the dht! You seth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axisâ€”â€

â€œTalki,â€ said s, â€œchop off her head!â€

Alice glanced rather anxiously at the ce if she mke
the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed noistening, t on again: â€œTwenty-four hours, I _think_; or
is it twelve? Iâ€”â€ donâ€™t b,â€ said the Duchess; â€œI never could abide
figures!â€ And with than nursing again, singing a
sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it shake at
 every line:

â€œSpeak roughly to your little boy,
    And beat himneezes:
Hs it to annoy,
    Because he knows it teases.â€


CHORUS.
(In wook and thned):


â€œWow! wow! wow!â€


While the Duchess sang the secondthe song, ossing
the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howlat Alice cy hear the words:â€”

â€œI speak severely to my boy,
    I beat himneezes;
Fthoroughly enjoy
    The pepper when he pleases!â€


CHORUS.

ow! wow!â€Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!â€ the Duchess said to Alicng the babs she spoke. â€œI must go and get ready to play
croquet with the Queeshe hurriehe room. The cook
threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, but ised her.
ught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped
little cnd held ou and legs in all directions,
â€œjust like a star-fish,â€ thought Alior little 
snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling
ind straighelf out again, so that altogether, for
the first minute or two, it waas she couold it.

As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (to
twist  a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right
ear and left f to prevening itself,) she carried it
out into the open air. â€œIf I donâ€™t taild away w
thought Alice, â€œtheyâ€™re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldnâ
murder tobehind?â€ She said the last words out loud, and the
little thing gruply (it ha sneezing by this time).
â€œDonâ€™t grunt,â€ said Alice; â€œthatâ€™sl a properxpressing yourself.â€

The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very into itssee what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had
urn-up nosre like a snout than a real nose; also
its eyes were getting extremelr a baby:  Alice did
not like the look of the thing at all. â€œBut perhaps it wobbing,â€ht, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there
were any tears.
e were no If youâ€™re going to turn into a pig, my dear,â€
said Alice, serious™ll have ne to do with you. Mind
now!â€ The poor little thing sobbed again (orit was impo say which), and they went on for some while in silence.

Alice wasnning to trself, â€œNow, what am I to do
with this creature when I get it home?t grunted 
violently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This timould be _n about it: it was neither more nor less than
a pig, and she felt thatbe quite aher to carry it
further.

So she set the little creature down, and  relieved 
trot away quietly into the wood. â€œIf it had grown up,â€ she said t, â€œit woade a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes
rather a handsome pig, I thd she bega over other
children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and waing
to heif one only knew the right way to change themâ€”â€ when she
was a liled by seeeshire Cat sitting on a bough of
a tree a few yards off.

The Cat od when it  It looked good-natured, she
thought: still it had _very_ long claws t many tee
felt that it ought to be treated with respect.

â€œCheshire Puss,âan, ratheras she did not at all know
whether it would like the name: however, inned a lit. â€œCome, itâ€™s pleased so far,â€ thought Alice, and she went on.
ou tell mewhich way I ought to go from here?â€

â€œThat depends a good deal ou want to  said the Cat.

â€œI donâ€™t much care whereâ€”â€ said Alice.

â€oesnâ€™t mh way you go,â€ said the Cat.

â€œâ€”so long as I get _somewhere_,âdded as anon.

â€œOh, youâ€™re sure to do that,â€ said the Cat, â€œif you onlg
enough.ce felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another
question.ort of peobout here?â€

â€œIn _that_ direction,â€ the Cat said, waving its round, â€œltter: and in _that_ direction,â€ waving the other paw, â€œlives a
MaVisit eithe: theyâ€™re both mad.â€

â€œBut I donâ€™t want to go among mad peoice remarkOh, you canâ€™t help that,â€ said the Cat: â€œweâ€™re all mad here. I
Youâ€™re 
â€œHow do you know Iâ€™m mad?â€ said Alice.

â€œYou must be,â€ sa, â€œor yo™t have come here.â€

Alice didnâ€™t think that proved it at all; he went on 
do you know that youâ€™re mad?â€

â€œTo begin with,â€ said the Cogâ€™s notgrant that?â€

â€œI suppose so,â€ said Alice.

â€œWell, then,â€ent on, â€a dog growls when itâ€™s angry,
and wags its tail when itâ€™s pleasedgrowl whenased,
and wag my tail when Iâ€™m angry. Therefore Iâ€™m mad.â€

â€it purringling,â€ said Alice.

â€œCall it what you like,â€ said the Cat. â€œy croquet Queen to-day?â€

â€œI should like it very much,â€ said Alice, â€œbâ€™t been et.â€

â€œYouâ€™ll see me there,â€ said the Cat, and vanished.

not much st this, she was getting so used to queer
things happening. While she g at the p it had been,
it suddenly appeared again.

â€œBy-the-bye, what becababy?â€ st. â€œIâ€™d nearly
forgotten to ask.â€

â€œIt turned into a pig,â€ietly saidif it had come back
in a natural way.

â€œI thought it would,â€ sa, and vani.

Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it didar, and afte or two she walked on in the direction in
which the March Hare was ve. â€œIâ€atters before,â€ she
said to herself; â€œthe March Hare will be muchinterestinrhaps as this is May it wonâ€™t be raving madâ€”at least not so mad asn March.â€aid this, she looked up, and there was the Cat
again, sitting on a brtree.

âsay pig, or fig?â€ said the Cat.

â€œI said pig,â€ replied Alice; ish you woeep appearing
and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.â€ right,â€Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,
beginning with the end o, and endie grin, which
remained some time after the rest of it had gone.

â€™ve often  without a grin,â€ thought Alice; â€œbut a
grin without a cat! Itâ€™ curious tr saw in my life!â€

She had not gone much farther before she came f the housMarch Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the
chimnhaped likethe roof was thatched with fur. It
was so large a house, that she didto go neare had
nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised h about two: even then she walked up towards it rather
timidly, saying to herselse it shoung mad after all!
I almost wish Iâ€™d gone to see the Hatter instead!

CHAPTERad Tea-Party


There was a table set out under a tree in front of tand the
Mand the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting
between  asleep, aer two were using it as a
cushion, resting their elbows on it, and ta its head.uncomfortable for the Dormouse,â€ thought Alice; â€œonly, as itâ€™s asuppose it mind.â€

The table was a large one, but the three were all crowdedat
one co: â€œNo room! No room!â€ they cried out when they saw
Alice coming. ™s _plentyâ€ said Alice indignantly, and
she sat down in a large arm-chair at  the tableve some wine,â€ the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.

Alice  round thet there was nothing on it but tea.
â€œI donâ€™t see any wine,â€ she 

â€œTherany,â€ said the March Hare.

â€œThen it wasnâ€™t very civil of you t,â€ saidrily.

â€œIt wasnâ€™t very civil of you to sit down without being insaid
the .

â€œI didnâ€™t know it was _your_ table,â€ said Alice; â€œitâ€™s  great
maan three.â€

â€œYour hair wants cutting,â€ said the Hatter. He hading at
Alme time with great curiosity, and this was his first
speech.

â€œYoearn not tsonal remarks,â€ Alice said with some
severity; â€œitâ€™s very rude. Hatter opyes very wide on hearing this; but all he _said_
was, â€œWhy is a ravwriting-deâ€œCome, we shall have some fun now!â€ thought Alice. â€œIâ€™m glad tbegun aski.â€”I believe I can guess that,â€ she added aloud.

â€œDo you mean hink you ct the answer to it?â€ said
the March Hare.

â€œExactly so,â€ said
â€œThen ysay what you mean,â€ the March Hare went on.

â€œI do,â€ Alice hased; â€œat  least I mean what I
sayâ€”thatâ€™s the same thing, you know.â€

âsame thing said the Hatter. â€œYou might just as well
say that â€˜I see what I the same t˜I eat what I seeâ€™!â€

â€œYou might just as well say,â€ added thre, â€œthae what
I getâ€™ is the same thing as â€˜I get what I likeâ€™!â€

ât just as € added the Dormouse, who seemed to be
talking in his sleep, â€œthatthe when Iis the same thing
as â€˜I sleep when I breatheâ€™!â€

â€œIt _is_ ting with yd the Hatter, and here the
conversation dropped, and the party sat si minute, we thought over all she could remember about ravens and
writing-desks,nâ€™t muchatter was the first to break the silence. â€œWhat day of the month

pocket, and was looking at it shaking it and then,
and holding it to his ear.

Alice considered a little, aid â€œThe 

â€œTwo days wrong!â€ sighed the Hatter. â€œI told you butter woult
the woradded looking angrily at the March Hare.

â€œIt was the _best_ butteMarch Hareplied.

â€œYes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,â€ the Hated:
â€œyo€™t have put it in with the bread-knife.â€

The March Hare took the looked atly: then he dipped
it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: bu think ofetter to say than his first remark, â€œIt was the _best_ butter,

Alice haking over his shoulder with some curiosity. â€œWhat a
funny watch!â€ked. â€œIt day of the month, and doesnâ€™t
tell what oâ€™clock it is!â€

â€œ it?â€ mu Hatter. â€œDoes _your_ watch tell you what
year it is?â€

â€œOf câ€ Alice ry readily: â€œbut thatâ€™s because it
stays the same year for such a together.Which is just the case with _mine_,â€ said the Hatter.

Alice felt  puzzled, â€™s remark seemed to have no
sort of meaning in it, and yet it was cnglish. â€ quite
understand you,â€ she said, as politely as she could.

â€œTe is aslee said the Hatter, and he poured a little
hot tea upon its nose.

Te shook itatiently, and said, without opening its
eyes, â€œOf course, of courset I was goark myself.â€

â€œHave you guessed the riddle yet?â€ the Hatter sag to Alice
â€œNo, I give it up,â€ Alice replied: â€œwhatâ€™s the answer?â€
nâ€™t the idea,â€ said the Hatter.

â€œNor I,â€ said the March Hare.

Alicearily. â€ou might do something better with the
time,â€ she said, â€œthan wastking riddlve no

â€œIf you knew Time as well as I do,â€ said the€œyou woulk
about wasting _it_. Itâ€™s _him_.â€

â€œI donâ€™t know what you aid Alice.course you donâ€™t!â€ the Hatter said, tossing his head
contemptuousare say yoen spoke to Time!â€

â€œPerhaps not,â€ Alice cautiously replied: âow I have ime when I learn music.â€

â€œAh! that accounts for it,â€ said the€œHe wonâ€eating.

(â€œI only wish it was,â€ the March Hare said in a whis€œThat would be grand, certainly,â€ said Alice thoughtfully: â€œbut thouldnâ€™t for it, you know.â€

â€œNot at first, perhaps,â€ said the Hatter:u could kehalf-past one as long as you liked.â€

â€œYes,it,â€ saier with a sigh: â€œitâ€™s always tea-time,
and weâ€™ve no time to wasgs between

â€œEx€ said thâ€œas the things get used up.â€

â€œBut what happens when you come inning agace ventured
to ask.

â€œSuppose we change the subject,â€ the Marchrrupted, y€œIâ€™m getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.Iâ€™m afra™t know one,â€ said Alice, rather alarmed at the
proposal.

â€œTheouse shallboth cried. â€œWake up, Dormouse!â€ And
they pinched it on both side

The Dowly opened his eyes. â€œI wasnâ€™t asleep,â€ he said in a

â€œTell us a story!â€ said the Mar
â€œYes, â€ pleaded Alice.

â€œAnd be quick about it,â€ added the Hatter, â™ll be asl

â€œOnce upon a time there were three little€ the Dorn

â€œThey couldnâ€™t have done that, you know,â€ Aliremarked;™d have been ill.â€

â€œSo they were,â€ said the Dormouse; â€œ_ver

take more.â€

â€œYou mean you canâ€ess_,â€ stter: â€œitâ€™s very easy to
take _more_ than nothing.â€

â€œNobodour_ opinid Alice.

â€œWhoâ€™s making personal remarks now?â€ the Hatter askently.

Aot quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to

repeated her question. â€œWhy did they l bottom of

The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and thâ€œIt was well.â€

â€œThereâ€™s no such thing!â€ Alice was beginning very an the
Hatt March Hare went â€œSh! sh!â€ and the Dormouse sulkily
remarked, â€œâ€™t be ci™d better finish the story for
yourself.â€

â€œNo, please go on!â€id very hu wonâ€™t interrupt again. I
dare say there may be _one_.â€

â€œOne€ said th indignantly. However, he consented to
go on. â€œAnd so these three lersâ€”theyning to draw,
you knowâ€”â€

â€œWhat did they draw?â€ said Alice,getting he

â€œTreacle,â€ said the Dormouse, without considering at all this €œI want a,â€ interrupted the Hatter: â€œletâ€™s all move one place
on.â€

n as he sphe Dormouse followed him: the March Hare
moved into the Dormouseâ€™s  Alice ratingly took the
place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one w
advantag change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than
before, as the Marc just upse-jug into his plate.

Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse agaibegan veryly: â€œBut I donâ€™t understand. Where did they draw the treacle
fromœYou can dout of a water-well,â€ said the Hatter; â€œso I should
think you coueacle out le-wellâ€”eh, stupid?â€

â€œBut they were _in_ the well,â€ Alice s Dormouse,ing
to notice this last remark.

â€œOf course they were,â€ said th; â€œâ€”we

This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on time withupting it.

The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was goio a
doze;eing pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a
little shriek, an â€œâ€”thaith an M, such as
mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchnessw you saye â€œmuch of a muchnessâ€â€”did you ever see such a thing as a

â€œThuldnâ€™t talk,â€ said the Hatter.

This piece of rudeness was more  could bea up in
great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instanneither ofs took the least notice of her going, though she
looked back once or f hoping tould call after her:
the last time she saw them, they were trying to rmouse intpot.

â€œAt any rate Iâ€™ll never go _there_ again!â€ said Alice asd her
wayhe wood. â€œItâ€™s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in

Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close tle

and begag the littkey, and unlocking the door that
led into the garden. Then she went tbling at tm

herself at last in the beaden, amongt flower-beds
and the cool fountains.




CHAPTER VIII.
The Quequet-Grounarge rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses
growiere white, were three gardeners at it, busily
painting them red. Alice thought y curious  she
went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she hof them sa out now, Five! Donâ€™t go splashing paint over me
like that!â€

ââ€™t help d Five, in a sulky tone; â€œSeven jogged my
elbow.â€

On which Sevup and saiâ€™s right, Five! Always lay the
blame on others!â€

â€œ_Youâ€™d_  talk!â€  â€œI heard the Queen say only
yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!What for?âe one who had spoken first.

â€œThatâ€™s none of _your_ business, Tw Seven.
t _is_ his business!â€ said Five, â€œand Iâ€™ll tell himâ€”it was for the cook s instead of onions.â€

Seven flung down his brush, and had just bel, of all 
thingsâ€”â€ when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood whem, and hhimself suddenly: the others looked round also,
and all of them bowed€œWould yoâ€ said Alice, a little timidly, â€œwhy you are
painting those rosesve and Sevthing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low
voice, â€œWhy the fact i, Miss, thght to have been a
_red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistf the Queefind it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So
you sweâ€™re dost, afore she comes, toâ€”â€ At this
moment Five, who had been anxiong across , called
out â€œThe Queen! The Queen!â€ and the three gardeners instw
themselpon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,
and Alice lookeager to sen.

First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped liree gardeng and flat, with their hands and feet at the
corners: next the ten cohese were  all over with
diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did.se came
thildren; there were ten of them, and the little dears came
jumping meg hand in ouples: they were all
ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, ms and Queemong them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a
hurrs manner,  everything that was said, and went
by without noticing her. Then folKnave of Hrying
the Kingâ€™s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of aland proces THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.

Alice was rather doubtful whether sht to lie d face
like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever havinf such a rcessions; â€œand besides, what would be the use of a
procession,â€ t, â€œif pell to lie down upon their
faces, so that they couldnâ€™t see it?â€ Sd still whs,
and waited.

When the procession came opposite to Alice, they aland lookedand the Queen said severely â€œWho is this?â€ She said it to the
Knats, who onnd smiled in reply.

â€œIdiot!â€ said the Queen, tossing her head i; and, turlice, she went on, â€œWhatâ€™s your name, child?â€

â€œMy name is Alease your€ said Alice very politely;
but she added, to herself, â€œWhy, theyâa pack of er
all. I neednâ€™t be afraid of them!â€

â€œAnd who are _these?_âe Queen, p the three gardeners
who were lying round the rose-tree; for, you seewere lying faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of
the could nother they were gardeners, or soldiers,
or courtiers, or three of her en.

â€œ _I_ know?â€ said Alice, surprised at her own courage. â€œItâ€™s
no f _mine_.âQueen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a
momenild beast,â€œOff with her head! Offâ€”â€

â€œNonsense!â€ said Alice, very loecidedly, een was
silent.

The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly ssider, my is only a child!â€

The Queen turned angrily away from him, and saKnave â€œTover!â€

The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.

â€œGetid the Quehrill, loud voice, and the three
gardeners instantly jumped up, and bg to the Kueen,
the royal children, and everybody else.

â€œLeave off that!â€ the Queenake me giddy.â€ And then,
turning to the rose-tree, she went on, â€œ_ you beenre?â€

â€œMay it please your Majesty,â€ said Two, in a very humbleng
down o as he spoke, â€œwe were tryingâ€”â€

â€œ_I_ see!â€ said the Queenmeanwhile ning the roses.
â€œOff with their heads!â€ and the procession moved of the
soaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran
to Alice tion.

ââ€™t be beheaded!â€ said Alice, and she put them into a large
flowerstood neare soldiers wandered about for a
minute or two, looking for them, and ly marched the
others.

â€œAre their heads off?â€ shouted the Queen.

â€œT are gone,ase your Majesty!â€ the soldiers shouted
in reply.

â€œThatâ€™s riouted the Can you play croquet?â€

The soldiers were silent, and looked at Ale questionently meant for her.

â€œYes!â€ shouted Alice.

â€œCome on, then! the Queene joined the procession,
wondering very much what would happen next.™sâ€”itâ€™ine day!â€ said a timid voice at her side. She was
walking by the Wh, who was xiously into her face.

â€œVery,â€ said Alice: â€œâ€”whereâ€™s the 

â€œHu€ said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked
anxiously over hr as he sphen raised himself upon
tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and w€œSheâ€™s tence of execution.â€

â€œWhat for?â€ said Alice.

â€œDid you saa pity!â€™abbit asked.

â€œNo, I didnâ€™t,â€ said Alice: â€œI donâ€™t think ill a pity.€˜What for?â€™â€

â€œShe boxed the Queenâ€™s earsâ€”â€ the Rabbit ce gave a ream of laughter. â€œOh, hush!â€ the Rabbit whispered in a frightenedœThe Queen you! You see, she came rather late, and the
Queen saidâ€”â€

â€œG places!â€the Queen in a voice of thunder, and
people began running about in alns, tumblinst each
other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, an
began. Aht she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground
in her life; it wges and fu balls were live
hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldo double
 up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.

The cculty Alic first was in managing her flamingo:
she succeeded in getting its bodway, comfough,
under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just a got its n straightened out, and was going to give the
hedgehog a blow with its_would_ tw round and look
up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that sot help
bt laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was
going to begit was very to find that the hedgehog
had unrolled itself, and was in the act ofaway: besihis, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she
wand the hedand, as the doubled-up soldiers were
always getting up and walking of parts of , Alice
soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game
The playayed at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling
all the while, an for the hand in a very short time
the Queen was in a furious passion, and wentabout, and â€œOff with his head!â€ or â€œOff with her head!â€ about once in a
Alice bel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any
dispute with thut she knemight happen any minute,
â€œand then,â€ thought she, â€œwhat would be? Theyâ€™lly

appearance in the air: it puzzled hch at firster

to.â€

â€œHow ating on?â€ Cat, as soon as there was mouth
enough for it to speak with.

Alicill the eyd, and then nodded. â€œItâ€™s no use
speaking to it,â€ she thought, s ears hav at least one
of them.â€ In another minute the whole head appeared, lice put
lamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad
she had  listen toCat seemed to think that there
was enough of it now in sight, and no  appeared.onâ€™t think they play at all fairly,â€ Alice began, in rather a
comone, â€œan quarrel so dreadfully one canâ€™t hear
oneself speakâ€”and they donâo have anyparticular; at
least, if there are, nobody attends to themâ€”and youâea how
co is all the things being alive; for instance, thereâ€™s the
arch Iâ€™go throughing about at the other end of the
groundâ€”and I should have croquetenâ€™s hedgnow, only
it ran away when it saw mine coming!â€

â€œHow do you lien?â€ saiin a low voice.

â€œNot at all,â€ said Alice: â€œsheâ€™s so extremeust then s
that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,
â€œto win, thhardly worth while finishing the game.â€

The Queen smiled and passâ€œWho _arking to?â€ said the King, going up to Alice, and
looking at the Catâith great 

â€œItâ€™s a friend of mineâ€”a Cheshire Cat,â€ said Alice: â€œallintroduce â€œI donâ€™t like the look of it at all,â€ said the King: â€œhowever,iss my hankes.â€

â€œIâ€™d rather not,â€ the Cat remarked.

â€œDonâ€™t be t,â€ said â€œand donâ€™t look at me like
that!â€ He got behind Alice as he spœA cat may king,â€ said Alice. â€œIâ€™ve read that in some book,
but I donâ€™twhere.â€, it must be removed,â€ said the King very decidedly, and he called

â€œIâ€™ll fetch the executioner myself,â€ said the King ea he
hurri
Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was goi she heardâ€™s voice in the distance, screaming with
passion. She had already hentence th players to be
executed for having missed their turns, and she did no look
of all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew
whether iturn or notent in search of her hedgehog.

The hedgehog was engaged in a fight er hedgehoeemed
to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them wiher: the oulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to
the other side of the ere Alice it trying in a
helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.

By the ad caught go and brought it back, the fight
was over, and both the hedgehogs wesight: â€œsnâ€™t
matter much,â€ thought Alice, â€œas all the arches are gone fide
of th€ So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not
escape agait back formore conversation with her
friend.

When she got back to the Cheshie was surpind quite
a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute goingn
the exethe King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,
while all the quite sileoked very uncomfortable.

The moment Alice appeared, she was appealel three tohe question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as theye at once, it very hard indeed to make out exactly
what they said.

The execu argument you couldnâ€™t cut off a head unless
there was a body to cut it off fhe had nevdo such a
thing before, and he wasnâ€™t going to begin at _his_ time 
The Kingent was, that anything that had a head could be
beheaded, and that yot to talk 

The Queenâ€™s argument was, that if something wasnâ€™t done about i than no td have everybody executed, all round. (It was
this last remark that he whole pao grave and
anxious.)

Alice could think of nothing else to say butongs to th: youâ€™d better ask _her_ about it.â€

â€œSheâ€™s in prison,â€ thid to the r: â€œfetch her here.â€
And the executioner went off like an arrow.â€™s head ng away the moment he was gone, and, by the
time he had come back witess, it ha disappeared; so
the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down r it,

CHAPTER IX.
The Mock TStory

nâ€™t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!â€
sahess, as sher arm affectionately into Aliceâ€™s,
and they walked off together.as very gl her in such a pleasant temper, and thought
to herself that perhaps i the peppe made her so
savage when they met in the kitchen.

â€œWhen _Iâ€™m_ â€ she saelf, (not in a very hopeful
tone though), â€œI wonâ€™t have any peppetchen _at 
does very well withoutâ€”Maybe itâ€™s always pepper that makes peoplpered,â€ n, very much pleased at having found out a new
kind of rule, â€œand vt makes thand camomile that makes
them bitterâ€”andâ€”and barley-sugar and suchat make cheet-tempered. I only wish people knew _that_: then they wouldnâ€™t be about it,€”â€

She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a lrtled when her voice close to her ear. â€œYouâ€™re thinking
about something, my that makeet to talk. I canâ€™t
tell you just now what the moral of that is, buremember it.â€

â€œPerhaps it hasnâ€™t one,â€ Alice ventured to remark.

â, child!â€ Duchess. â€œEverythingâ€™s got a moral, if only
you can find it.â€ ueezed heroser to Aliceâ€™s side as
she spoke.

Alice did not much like keepie to her: ause the
Duchess was _very_ ugly; and secondly, because she was exactght heighter chin upon Aliceâ€™s shoulder, and it was an
uncomfortably sharp chr, she didto be rude, so she
bore it as well as she could.

â€œThe gameâ€™s gther betteshe said, by way of keeping up
the conversation a little.

â€œâ€™Tiaid the Duand the moral of that isâ€”â€˜Oh, â€™tis love,
â€™tis love, that maked go round
â€œSomebody said,â€ Alice whispered, â€œthat itâ€™s done by everybod
their ownâ€

â€œAh, well! It means much the same thing,â€ said the Duchess,er
sharp n into Aliceâ€™s shoulder as she added, â€œand the moral of
_that_ is care of tand the sounds will take care of
themselves.â€™â€

â€œHow fond sheding morals!â€ Alice thought to
herself.

â€œI dare say youâ€™re wondering w™t put my your waist,â€
the Duchess said after a pause: â€œthe reason is, thatbtful abouper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?â€

â€œHe might bice cautioud, not feeling at all anxious
to have the experiment tried.

â€œVer said the €œflamingoes and mustard both bite. And
the moral of that isâ€”â€˜Birather floc.â€™â€

â€œOnly mustard isnâ€™t a bird,â€ Alice remarked.

â€œRiual,â€ sahess: â€œwhat a clear way you have of
putting things!â€

â€œItâ€™s, I _think Alice.

â€œOf course it is,â€ said the Duchess, who seemed ready t
everythiice said; â€œthereâ€™s a large mustard-mine near here.
And the moral â€”â€˜The  is of mine, the less there is
of yours.â€™â€

â€œOh, I know!â€ elice, who tended to this last
remark, â€œitâ€™s a vegetable. It doesnâ€™t look but it is.I quite agree with you,â€ said the Duchess; â€œand the moral of thate what youm to beâ€™â€”or if youâ€™d like it put more
simplyâ€”â€˜Never imaginenot to be than what it might
appear to others that what you were or might have ot
otherwhat you had been would have appeared to them to be
otherwise.â€™â€
nk I shoulnd that better,â€ Alice said very politely,
â€œif I had it written d canâ€™t qw it as you say it.â€

â€œThatâ€™s nothing to what I could say if I the Duche,
in a pleased tone.

â€œPray donâ€™t trouble yourself to say it anhan that,âlice.

â€œOh, donâ€™t talk about trouble!â€ said the Duchess. â€œI  present
ing Iâ€™ve said as yet.â€

â€œA cheap sort of present!â€ thought Aâ€™m glad ™t give
birthday presents like that!â€ But she did not venture to saloud.

â again?â€ the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp
little chIâ€™ve a rink,â€ said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to
feel a little woâ€œJust abh right,â€ said the Duchess, â€œas pigs have to fly; and
the mâ€”â€re, to Aliat surprise, the Duchessâ€™s voice died away,
even in the middle of hte word â€ and the arm that was
linked into hers began to tremble. Alice lookedhere stoodn in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a
thunderstor fine day,sty!â€ the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.

â€œNow, I give you ng,â€ shoueen, stamping on the
ground as she spoke; â€œeither you or your headff, and thut half no time! Take your choice!â€

The Duchess took her choice, ne in a mo€œLetâ€™s go on with the game,â€ the Queen said to Alice; and Alice wch frighte a word, but slowly followed her back to the
croquet-ground.

The os had takee of the Queenâ€™s absence, and were
resting in the shade: however, tthey saw hurried
back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a momentâ€™suld cost tlives.

All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarith the ots, and shouting â€œOff with his head!â€ or â€œOff with
her head!â€  she sentetaken into custody by the
soldiers, who of course had to leave off be to do thit by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and
allrs, except the Queen, and Alice, were in custody
and under sentence of executio the Queen quite out of breath, and said to Alice, â€œHave
you seen the Mock Tu€

â€œN Alice. â€œI donâ€™t even know what a Mock Turtle is.â€

â€œItâ€™s Mock Turtlmade from,â€ said the Queen.

â€œI never saw one, or heard of one,âice.

â€then,â€ said the Queen, â€œand he shall tell you his history.â€

Aked off toice heard the King say in a low voice,
to the company generally, â€œY pardoned.e, _thatâ€™s_ a
good thing!â€ she said to herself, for she had felt ppy at thef executions the Queen had ordered.

They very soon came upon a Gryp fast aslesun. (If
you donâ€™t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) â€
thing!â€Queen, â€œand take this young lady to see the Mock
Turtle, and to heaory. I musand see after some
executions I have ordered;â€ and she walked off, ice aloneGryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature,
but on the thought e quite as safe to stay with it
as to go after that savage Queen: so .

The G up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till
she was out ohen it chuWhat fun!â€ said the Gryphon,
half to itself, half to Alice.

â€œWhe fun?â€e.

â€œWhy, _she_,â€ said the Gryphon. â€œItâ€™s all her fancy, thaver
execu, you know. Come on!â€

â€œEverybody says â€˜come on!â€™ here,â€ tce, as shely
after it: â€œI never was so ordered about in all my life, never!â€had not goore they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,
sitting sad and lonely e ledge of, as they came
nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart w. She
piteply. â€œWhat is his sorrow?â€ she asked the Gryphon, and the
Grypho, very nea same words as before, â€œItâ€™s all
his fancy, that: he hasnâ€™t got, you knowâ€

So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with larull of teaid nothing.

â€œThis here young lady,â€ said the Gryphon, â€œshe wa know your she do.â€

â€œIâ€™ll tell it her,â€ said the Mock Turtle in a deetone: â€œsboth of you, and donâ€™t speak a word till Iâ€™ve finished.â€

So twn, and no for some minutes. Alice thought to
herself, â€œI donâ€™t see how he  finish, iâ€™t begin.â€
But she waited patiently.

â€œOnce,â€ said the Mock last, witigh, â€œI was a real
Turtle.â€

These words were followed by a verence, brok an
occasional exclamation of â€œHjckrrh!â€ from the Gryphon, and th
heavy sohe Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and
saying, â€œThank for your g story,â€ but she could not
help thinking there _must_ be more to ce sat stil
nothing.

â€œWhen we were little,â€ the Mock Turtle went on at laalmly,
th sobbing a little now and then, â€œwe went to school in the
sea. The  an old Tuused to call him Tortoiseâ€”â€

â€œWhy did you call him Tortoise, i€™t one?â€ked.

â€œWe called him Tortoise because he taught us,â€ said the Mo
angrily: you are very dull!â€

â€œYou ought to be ashamed of yourself for asa simple
€ added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked
at pooho felt rek into the earth. At last the
Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, â€œDri fellow! Dall
day about it!â€ and he went on in these words:

â€œYes, we wenl in the s you maynâ€™t believe itâ€”â€

â€œI never said I didnâ€™t!â€ interce.

â€œ said the Mock Turtle.

â€œHold your tongue!â€ added the Gryphon, ce could s.
The Mock Turtle went on.

â€œWe had the best of educationsâ€”in fnt to schoayâ€”â€

â€œ_Iâ€™ve_ been to a day-school, too,â€ said Alice; â€œy™t be so
ll that.â€

â€œWith extras?â€ asked the Mock Turtle a little anxio€œYes,â€ , â€œwe learned French and music.â€

â€œAnd washing?â€ said the Mo

â€œCer!â€ said Alice indignantly.

â€œAh! then yours wasnâ€™t a really goâ€ said trtle in a
tone of great relief. â€œNow at _ours_ they had at the end l,
â€˜Fre, _and washing_â€”extra.â€™â€

The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one ross
